presented one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times with no proven cure or vac-cine. Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the spectrum of disease severity is not yet clear. Methods: We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverages to con-trol the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures imple-mented. Results: Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33). A vaccine with 70% effi-cacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination cover-age 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44-99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72-69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76-80.85%). Conclusions: Findings suggest a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to con-tain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics.","title":"Quantifying early COVID-19 outbreak transmission in South Africa and exploring vaccine efficacy scenarios","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: South Africa\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 2.95\\r\\n%CI values: (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33)\\r\\nmethod: mathematical model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"South Africa\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.95\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"mathematical model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"South Africa\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.95\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33)\\", \\"method\\": \\"mathematical model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020-04-29 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"4r9vb7ub","cord_uid":"4r9vb7ub","abstract":"Background COVID-19 continues to impose significant morbidity and mortality in Japan even after implementing the vaccination program. It would remain elusive if restrictions for its mitigation were to be lifted or relaxed in the future. Methods A simulation study that explored possible vaccination coverage scenarios and changes in the intensity of nonpharmaceutical intervention restrictions was performed to assess the impact of COVID-19 based on death count. Results Assuming the basic reproduction number of circulating viruses was 5.0, vaccines could prevent 90% of infections and 95% of deaths, and the vaccination coverage rate was high (75%, 80%, and 90% in people aged 12-39 years, 40-59 years, \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa560 years, respectively), approximately 50 000 deaths would occur over 150 days in Japan if all restrictions were lifted. Most deaths would occur among older adults, even if their vaccination coverage was assumed to be especially high. A low vaccination coverage scenario (45%, 60%, and 80% in people aged 12-39 years, 40-59 years, \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa560 years, respectively) would require periodic implementation of strict measures even if the modified lifestyle observed in 2020 was sustained and vaccines were very effective. Some restrictions could be relaxed under high vaccination coverage. However, in the worst-case scenario where vaccines had decreased efficacy, as we have observed for the Delta variant, and people lived a relaxed lifestyle, our simulation suggests that even high vaccination coverage would occasionally require strict measures. Conclusions We should carefully explore a manageable degree of restrictions and their relaxation. We will have to keep bracing for occasional surges of COVID-19 infection, which could lead to strict measures, such as those under a state of emergency. Such strategies are essential even after a wide rollout of vaccination.","title":"Simulation of future COVID-19 epidemic by vaccination coverage scenarios in Japan","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"l60snfap","cord_uid":"l60snfap","abstract":"Between April 2012 and June 2014, 820 laboratory-confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been reported in the Arabian Peninsula, Europe, North Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and the United States. The observed epidemiology is different to SARS, which showed a classic epidemic curve and was over in eight months. The much longer persistence of MERS-CoV in the population, with a lower reproductive number, some evidence of human-to-human transmission but an otherwise sporadic pattern, is difficult to explain. Using available epidemiological data, we implemented mathematical models to explore the transmission dynamics of MERS-CoV in the context of mass gatherings such as the Hajj pilgrimage, and found a discrepancy between the observed and expected epidemiology. The fact that no epidemic occurred in returning Hajj pilgrims in either 2012 or 2013 contradicts the long persistence of the virus in human populations. The explanations for this discrepancy include an ongoing, repeated nonhuman/sporadic source, a large proportion of undetected or unreported human-to-human cases, or a combination of the two. Furthermore, MERS-CoV is occurring in a region that is a major global transport hub and hosts significant mass gatherings, making it imperative to understand the source and means of the yet unexplained and puzzling ongoing persistence of the virus in the human population.","title":"A Scenario-Based Evaluation of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and the Hajj","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2014-01-01 00:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"b2yalnrx","cord_uid":"b2yalnrx","abstract":"This paper presents a simple mathematical model that answers how much testing and tracing we need to do to suppress new surges of COVID-19 infections after reopening. We derived the model by modifying the SEIR model taking into the effects of testing and tracing. The following equation is one of the essential outcomes of the model: {rho}>(R0S/N-1)/(D(1+{eta}R0)) Where {rho} is the percentage of infectious people that have to be detected per day, R0 is the basic reproduction number, S/N is the percentage of the susceptible population over the entire population, D is the length of the infectious period, and {eta} is the percentage of close contacts that have to be traced. If the above equation is satisfied, we can bring the effective reproduction number Re to below 1 to get the transmission suppressed. This model demonstrates that together with social-distancing measures such as wearing masks in public, with a reasonable amount of testing and tracing, we may suppress the COVID-19 transmission for good. For example, if social distancing measures can bring R0 to below 1.2, for D being 10 days, in places where 15% people have developed antibodies, we can suppress the transmission by detecting only 0.13% of the infectious population daily while tracing 50% of their close contacts.

Firstly, the period from 6 January to 31 March 2020 was divided into four stages and the relevant parameters were estimated according to the imported cases in Japan. The basic reproduction number of the current stage is 1.954 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851-2.025), which means COVID-19 will spread quickly, and the self-healing rate of Japanese is about 0.495 (95% CI 0.437-0.506), with small variations in the four stages. Secondly, the results were applied to the actual reported cases from 1 to 5 April 2020, verifying the reliability of the estimated data using the accumulated reported cases located within the 95% confidence interval and the relative error of forecast data of five days being less than 2 . 5 % . Thirdly, considering the medical resources in Japan, the times the epidemic beds and ventilators become fully occupied are predicted as 5 and 15 May 2020, respectively. Keeping with the current situation, the final death toll in Japan may reach into the millions. Finally, based on experience with COVID-19 prevention and control in China, robust measures such as nationwide shutdown, store closures, citizens isolating themselves at home, and increasing PCR testing would quickly and effectively prevent COVID-19 spread.","title":"Forecast Possible Risk for COVID-19 Epidemic Dissemination Under Current Control Strategies in Japan","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Japan\\r\\ndate: 6 January to 31 March 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 1.954\\r\\n%CI values: 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851-2.025\\r\\nmethod: estimating the current state of epidemic dissemination","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Japan\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"6 January to 31 March 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.954\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851-2.025\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"estimating the current state of epidemic dissemination\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Japan\\", \\"date\\": \\"6 January to 31 March 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.954\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% confidence interval (CI) 1.851-2.025)\\", \\"method\\": \\"-\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"ssrainqk","cord_uid":"ssrainqk","abstract":"The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Algeria was reported on 25 February 2020.

Understanding the accuracy and limitations of statistical methods to estimate the reproduction number, R0, in the context of emerging epidemics is therefore vital to ensure appropriate interpretation of results and the subsequent implications for control efforts. Using simulated epidemic data we assess the performance of 6 commonly-used statistical methods to estimate R0 as they would be applied in a real-time outbreak analysis scenario - fitting to an increasing number of data points over time and with varying levels of random noise in the data. Method comparison was also conducted on empirical outbreak data, using Zika surveillance data from the 2015-2016 epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean. We find that all methods considered here frequently over-estimate R0 in the early stages of epidemic growth on simulated data, the magnitude of which decreases when fitted to an increasing number of time points. This trend of decreasing bias over time can easily lead to incorrect conclusions about the course of the epidemic or the need for control efforts. We show that true changes in pathogen transmissibility can be difficult to disentangle from changes in methodological accuracy and precision, particularly for data with significant over-dispersion. As localised epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 take hold around the globe, awareness of this trend will be important for appropriately cautious interpretation of results and subsequent guidance for control efforts.","title":"A comparative analysis of statistical methods to estimate the reproduction number in emerging epidemics with implications for the current COVID-19 pandemic","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-05-16 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"vd8zhp77","cord_uid":"vd8zhp77","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Undifferentiated carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (UCOGCs) is a rare subtype of pancreatic cancer (PC), and its clinicopathological characteristics are still unclear.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old man was referred to us for evaluation of a pancreatic mass detected by computed tomography (CT) during a medical checkup. Computed tomography showed a 7.5-cm tumor located in the pancreatic head and body, which involved the common hepatic artery (CHA), gastroduodenal artery (GDA), and main portal vein (PV) with tumor thrombus. UCOGC was suspected by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration, and the patient was diagnosed with unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. After ten cycles of FOLFIRINOX, the tumor size decreased to 3 cm and the tumor thrombus in the main portal trunk had disappeared in the follow-up CT scan. However, the patient experienced severe adverse drug reactions, including neutropenia and liver dysfunction. Therefore, we performed pancreatoduodenectomy with portal vein resection. The pathological diagnosis was UCOGC with a negative tumor margin. He was treated with FOLFIRINOX, and remains recurrence-free for 6 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We experienced a case undergoing conversion surgery for unresectable UCOGC, which resulted in R0 resection.

To understand the COVID-19 outbreak in China and provide potential lessons for other parts of the world, in this study we apply a mathematical model with multiple datasets to estimate the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the severity of the illness associated with the infection, and how both were affected by unprecedented control measures. Our analyses show that before 19th January 2020, 3.5% (95% CI 1.7-8.3%) of infected people were detected; this percentage increased to 36.6% (95% CI 26.1-55.4%) thereafter. The basic reproduction number (R0) was 2.33 (95% CI 1.96-3.69) before 8th February 2020; then the effective reproduction number dropped to 0.04(95% CI 0.01-0.10). This estimation also indicates that control measures taken since 23rd January 2020 affected the transmissibility about 2 weeks after they were introduced. The confirmed case fatality rate is estimated at 9.6% (95% CI 8.1-11.4%) before 15 February 2020, and then it reduced to 0.7% (95% CI 0.4-1.0%). This shows that SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly transmissible but may be less severe than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We found that at the early stage, the majority of R0 comes from undetected infectious people. This implies that successful control in China was achieved through reducing the contact rates among people in the general population and increasing the rate of detection and quarantine of the infectious cases.","title":"Transmission dynamics and control measures of COVID-19 outbreak in China: a modelling study","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: China\\r\\ndate: before 8th February 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 2.33\\r\\n%CI values: 95% CI 1.96-3.69\\r\\nmethod: Mathematical Model with Multiple Datasets","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"China\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"before 8th February 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.33\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"95% CI 1.96-3.69\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Mathematical Model with Multiple Datasets\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"China\\", \\"date\\": \\"before 8th February 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.33\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CI 1.96-3.69)\\", \\"method\\": \\"mathematical model with multiple datasets\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"zq1pvawa","cord_uid":"zq1pvawa","abstract":"In this paper, a SIRD model is adapted to study the vaccine\'s impact on the spread of coronavirus (COVID19) spread in Lebanon.

The recent trend of vaccinating against COVID-19 pandemic reveals a strong control of infectious disease. On the other hand, it is observed in some countries that, the vaccine application offers less control over the spread of virus, since some portion of vaccinated people is not totally protected/immuned and viable to infection again after a while due to weak/loss immunity offered by the vaccine. This requires transition from vaccinated department to infected for COVID-19. This character of COVID-19 helps us reconsideration of the vaccinated department by letting some part of it being exposed to the infection again. Taking this into account, as a result of modification of the SIR model, the epidemiology is now governed with three main epidemic dimensionless parameters, having provided an initial fraction of infected individuals. The dimensionless model with these parameters is analyzed initially from the stability point of view. The effects of weak immunity are then illustrated numerically on some chosen parameter range. How some of the countries applying the COVID-19 vaccine programs affected by weak/loss immunity is eventually examined with the modified model. The rate of vaccination as well as the basic Reproduction number are found to affect the epidemic demography of the population subject to weak or loss of immunity. In the case of a high vaccination rate, the countries are not anticipated to be highly influenced by the weak immunity of low level, whereas weak immunity prolongs the contagious disease by appearance of secondary multiple peaks in the epidemic compartments with relatively small vaccination rates and basic Reproductive numbers.","title":"An extended epidemic model with vaccination: Weak-immune SIRVI","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2022-04-22 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"90ftzrif","cord_uid":"90ftzrif","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Imported COVID-19 cases, if unchecked, can jeopardize the effort of domestic containment. We aim to find out what sustainable border control options for different entities (e.g., countries, states) exist during the reopening phases, given their own choice of domestic control measures. METHODS: We propose a SUIHR model, which has built-in imported risk and (1-tier) contact tracing to study the cross-border spreading and control of COVID-19. Under plausible parameter assumptions, we examine the effectiveness of border control policies, in combination with internal measures, to confine the virus and avoid reverting back to more restrictive life styles again. RESULTS: When the basic reproduction number R0 of COVID-19 exceeds 2.5, even 100% effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the spreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically, and resumes \\"normal\\", without mandatory institutional quarantine, even very strict border control measures combined with effective contact tracing can only delay another outbreak by 6 months. For entities employing a confining domestic control policy, non-increasing net imported cases is sufficient to remain open. CONCLUSIONS: Extremely strict border control in entities, where domestic spreading is currently eliminated (e.g., China), is justifiable. However such harsh measure are not necessary for other places. Entities successfully confining the virus by internal measures can open up to similar entities without additional border controls so long as the imported risk stays non-increasing. Opening the borders to entities lacking sufficient internal control of the virus should be exercised in combination with pre-departure screening and tests upon arrival.","title":"Sustainable border control policy in the COVID-19 pandemic: A math modeling study","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"xdjgjeb9","cord_uid":"xdjgjeb9","abstract":"The number of COVID-19 cases is continuously increasing in different countries (as of March 2020) including the Philippines. It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4. The basic reproductive number characterizes the average number of persons that a primary case can directly infect in a population full of susceptible individuals. However, there can be superspreaders that can infect more than this estimated basic reproductive number. In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.","title":"A mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission between frontliners and the general public","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Philippines\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.5 to 4\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"mathematical model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020-03-30 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"htd6ocsc","cord_uid":"htd6ocsc","abstract":"Mathematical model for the transition dynamics and control of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Nigeria has been proposed for incorporating the impact of vaccination and prevention.

In the absence of evidence, individual communities had to take timely action to reduce the rate of disease spread and avoid overburdening their health care systems. Although a few predictive models have been published to guide these decisions, most have not taken into account spatial differences and have included assumptions that do not match the local realities. Access to reliable information that is adapted to local context is critical for policy makers to make informed decisions during a rapidly evolving pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to develop an adapted susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to predict the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina and the Charlotte Metropolitan Region, and to incorporate the effect of a public health intervention to reduce disease spread while accounting for unique regional features and imperfect detection. METHODS: Three SIR models were fit to infection prevalence data from North Carolina and the greater Charlotte Region and then rigorously compared. One of these models (SIR-int) accounted for a stay-at-home intervention and imperfect detection of COVID-19 cases. We computed longitudinal total estimates of the susceptible, infected, and removed compartments of both populations, along with other pandemic characteristics such as the basic reproduction number. RESULTS: Prior to March 26, disease spread was rapid at the pandemic onset with the Charlotte Region doubling time of 2.56 days (95% CI 2.11-3.25) and in North Carolina 2.94 days (95% CI 2.33-4.00). Subsequently, disease spread significantly slowed with doubling times increased in the Charlotte Region to 4.70 days (95% CI 3.77-6.22) and in North Carolina to 4.01 days (95% CI 3.43-4.83). Reflecting spatial differences, this deceleration favored the greater Charlotte Region compared to North Carolina as a whole. A comparison of the efficacy of intervention, defined as 1 - the hazard ratio of infection, gave 0.25 for North Carolina and 0.43 for the Charlotte Region. In addition, early in the pandemic, the initial basic SIR model had good fit to the data; however, as the pandemic and local conditions evolved, the SIR-int model emerged as the model with better fit. CONCLUSIONS: Using local data and continuous attention to model adaptation, our findings have enabled policy makers, public health officials, and health systems to proactively plan capacity and evaluate the impact of a public health intervention. Our SIR-int model for estimated latent prevalence was reasonably flexible, highly accurate, and demonstrated efficacy of a stay-at-home order at both the state and regional level. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating local context into pandemic forecast modeling, as well as the need to remain vigilant and informed by the data as we enter into a critical period of the outbreak.","title":"Modeling COVID-19 Latent Prevalence to Assess a Public Health Intervention at a State and Regional Scale: Retrospective Cohort

Importantly, epidemics with lower R(0) can be larger if they spread more homogeneously (and are therefore more robust to stochastic fluctuations). We illustrate the potential of this approach using different real epidemics with known estimates for R(0), heterogeneity and epidemic size in the absence of significant intervention. Further, we discuss the different ways in which this framework can be implemented in the data-scarce reality of emerging pathogens. Lastly, we demonstrate that without data on the heterogeneity in secondary infections for emerging infectious diseases like COVID-19 the uncertainty in outbreak size ranges dramatically.

Accounting for presymptomatic infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We estimate 87% (lower bound 53%) of the infections before March 8 were unascertained, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases; and a basic reproduction number R0 of 3.54 (95% credible interval [CrI]: 3.40-3.67) in the early outbreak, much higher than for SARS and MERS4,5. We observe that multi-pronged interventions had considerable positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the reproduction number to 0.28 (0.23-0.33) and by projection reducing the total infections in Wuhan by 96.0% as of March 8. We furthermore explore the probability of resurgence following lifting of all interventions after 14 days of no ascertained infections, estimating it at 0.32 and 0.06 based on models with 87% and 53% unascertained infections, respectively, highlighting the risk posed by unascertained cases in changing intervention strategies.

The time-varying instantaneous reproductive number is useful for monitoring the real time dynamics of a disease to inform policy making for disease control. Local estimation of this metric, for instance at a county or city level, allows for more targeted interventions to curb transmission. However, simultaneous estimation of local reproductive numbers must account for potential sources of heterogeneity in these time-varying quantities -- a key element of which is human mobility. We develop a statistical method that incorporates human mobility between multiple regions for estimating region-specific instantaneous reproductive numbers. The model also can account for exogenous cases imported from outside of the regions of interest. We propose two approaches to estimate the reproductive numbers, with mobility data used to adjust incidence in the first approach and to inform a formal priori distribution in the second (Bayesian) approach. Through a simulation study, we show that region-specific reproductive numbers can be well estimated if human mobility is reasonably well approximated by available data. We use this approach to estimate the instantaneous reproductive numbers of COVID-19 for 14 counties in Massachusetts using CDC case report data and the human mobility data collected by SafeGraph. We found that, accounting for mobility, our method produces estimates of reproductive numbers that are distinct across counties. In contrast, independent estimation of county-level reproductive numbers tends to produce similar values, as trends in county case-counts for the state are fairly concordant. These approaches can also be used to estimate any heterogeneity in transmission, for instance, age-dependent instantaneous reproductive number estimates. As people are more mobile and interact frequently in ways that permit transmission, it is important to account for this in the estimation of the reproductive number.","title":"Estimation of heterogeneous instantaneous reproduction numbers with application to characterize SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Massachusetts counties","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-12-05 05:00:00","cluster_id":"411"},{"main_cord_uid":"nkyhcs0c","cord_uid":"nkyhcs0c","abstract":"Background: Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe outcomes from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but the pathophysiology underlying this increased morbidity and its potential effect on the developing fetus is not well understood. Methods: We assessed placental histology, ACE2 expression, and viral and immune dynamics at the term placenta in pregnant women with and without respiratory severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Findings: The majority (13 of 15) of placentas analyzed had no detectable viral RNA. ACE2 was detected by immunohistochemistry in syncytiotrophoblast cells of the normal placenta during early pregnancy but was rarely seen in healthy placentas at full term, suggesting that low ACE2 expression may protect the term placenta from viral infection. Using immortalized cell lines and primary isolated placental cells, we found that cytotrophoblasts, the trophoblast stem cells and precursors to syncytiotrophoblasts, rather than syncytiotrophoblasts or Hofbauer cells, are most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. To better understand potential immune mechanisms shielding placental cells from infection in vivo, we performed bulk and single-cell transcriptomics analyses and found that the maternal-fetal interface of SARS-CoV-2-infected women exhibited robust immune responses, including increased activation of natural killer (NK) and T cells, increased expression of interferon-related genes, as well as markers associated with pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia.

[Image: see text] METHODS: Four parameters of the SEIR model were obtained by international experiences: the incubation period = 3.7 in days, the proportion of critical cases = 0.05, the overall case-fatality rate = 0.023, and the asymptomatic proportion of COVID-19 = 0.18. The critical step in the prediction of COVID-19 by the model is the value of R0 (the basic reproduction number) and T_infectious (the infectious period, in days). R0 and T_infectious for each phase of the curve are calculated by mathematical constrained optimization, a numerical method. Differently from a statistical modelling, a numerical method is a type of mathematical modelling that is not dependent on a probability distribution. The objective function that measures the model error is minimized with respect to R0 and T_infectious in the presence of constraints on those variables. For R0, constraints are valid range of values (0.5 \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa4 R0 \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa4 20). For T_infectious, constraints also are related to its range of values (2 \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa4 T_infectious \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa4 14). A Solver from Excel or NEOS Server, for example, can be used for finding numerically minimum of a function Z, that represents the sum of absolute value of errors between COVID-19 new cases observed in one day, and COVID-19 cases predicted by the SEIR model (Fig. 2 and 3).

[Image: see text] RESULTS: The ECDC has registered 8,142,129 COVID-19 in the world on Jun/17/2020. R0 and T_infectious calculated for a three phases curve in USA, with a stabilized scenario (Fig. 4: R0_1=1.0; T_infectious_1=2; R0_2=17.4; T_infectious_2=2; R0_3=1.0; T_infectious_3=14), a two phases curve in Brazil (Fig. 5: R0_1=8.0; T_infectious_1=9; R0_2=1.3; T_infectious_2=6), and a three phases model for France (Fig. 6: R0_1=4.3; T_infectious_1=11; R0_2=9.3; T_infectious_2=11; R0_3=0.5; T_infectious_3=12).

Understanding the severity and distribution in various regions will help in planning the controlling measures. Objectives: The objective was to assess the distribution and growth rate of COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu, India. Methods: The data on the number of infections of COVID-19 have been obtained from the media reports released by the Government of Tamil Nadu. The data contain information on the incidence of the disease for the first 41 days of the outbreak started on March 7, 2020. Log-linear model has been used to estimate the progression of the COVID-19 infection in Tamil Nadu. Separate models were employed to model the growth rate and decay rate of the disease. Spatial Poisson regression was used to identify the high-risk areas in the state. Results: : The models estimated the doubling time for the number of cases in growth phase as 3.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.70, 9.42) days and halving time in the decay phase as 12.08 (95% CI: 6.79, 54.78) days. The estimated median reproduction numbers were 1.88 (min = 1.09, max = 2.51) and 0.76 (min = 0.56, max = 0.99) in the growth and decay phases, respectively. The spatial Poisson regression identified 11 districts as high risk.

For control measures to be more effective, a measure of the heterogeneity of the parameters is desirable. METHODS: We propose a novel extension of a network-based approach to estimating the reproductive number. With this we can incorporate spatial and/or demographic information through a similarity matrix. We apply this to the 2009 Influenza pandemic in South Africa to understand the spatial variability across provinces. We explore the use of five similarity matrices to illustrate their impact on the subsequent epidemic parameter estimates. RESULTS: When treating South Africa as a single entity with homogeneous transmission characteristics across the country, the basic reproductive number, R(0), (and imputation range) is 1.33 (1.31, 1.36). When fitting a new model for each province with no inter-province connections this estimate varies little (1.23-1.37). Using the proposed method with any of the four similarity measures yields an overall R(0) that varies little across the four new models (1.33 to 1.34). However, when allowed to vary across provinces, the estimated R(0) is greater than one consistently in only two of the nine provinces, the most densely populated provinces of Gauteng and Western Cape. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of influenza transmission was compelling in South Africa during the 2009 pandemic. This variability makes a qualitative difference in our understanding of the epidemic. While the cause of this fluctuation might be partially due to reporting differences, there is substantial evidence to warrant further investigation.","title":"Estimating the reproductive number in the

Out of 286 retrieved SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes from India, 138 haplotypes were generated and analyzed. Median-joining network was built to investigate the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 haplotypes in India. The BDSIR package of BEAST2 was used to calculate the reproduction number (R0) and the infectious rate of the virus. Past and current population trend was investigated using the stamp date method in coalescent Bayesian skyline plot, implemented in BEAST2 and by exponential growth prior in BEAST 1.10.4. Median-joining network reveals two distinct ancestral clusters A and B showing genetic affinities with Wuhan outbreak sample. The network also illustrates the autochthonous development of isolates in a few instances. High basic reproduction number of SARS-nCoV-2 in India points towards the phase of active community transmission. The Bayesian skyline plot revel exponential rise in the effective population size (Ne) of Indian isolates from the first week of January to the first week of April 2020.

Methods: The R0 of COVID-19 was estimated using the serial interval distribution and the number of incidence cases. The serial interval was fit with a gamma distribution. The probable incidence and cumulative incidence in the next 30 days were predicted using the assumption that daily incidence follows a Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. Data analysis was done using earlyR and projections packages in R software. Results: The maximum-likelihood value of R0 was 2.7 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1 to 3.4) for the COVID-19 epidemic in the early 14 days and decreased to 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.25) by the end of the day 41.

Dynamics of the system with and without impulses have been analyzed using the basic reproduction number. This study shows that the proper dosing interval and drug dose both are important to eradicate the viral infection.","title":"A Model for SARS-CoV-2 Infection with Treatment","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"zanh629x","cord_uid":"zanh629x","abstract":"BACKGROUND The transmission potential of primary pneumonic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, is one of the key epidemiological determinants of a potential biological weapon, and requires clarification and time dependent interpretation. METHOD This study estimated the reproduction number and its time dependent change through investigations of outbreaks in Mukden, China (1946), and Madagascar (1957). Reconstruction of an epidemic tree, which shows who infected whom, from the observed dates of onset was performed using the serial interval. Furthermore, a likelihood based approach was used for the time inhomogeneous evaluation of the outbreaks for which there was scarcity of cases. RESULTS According to the estimates, the basic reproduction number, R(0), was on the order of 2.8 to 3.5, which is higher than previous estimates. The lower 95% confidence intervals of R(0) exceeded unity. The effective reproduction number declined below unity after control measures were introduced in Mukden, and before the official implementation in Madagascar. CONCLUSION While the time course of the latter outbreak could be explained by intrinsic factors and stochasticity in this remote and scarcely populated area, the former in Mukden suggests the possible continued chains of transmission in highly populated areas. Using the proposed methods, the who infected whom information permitted the evaluation of the time inhomogeneous transmission potential in relation to public health measures. The study also tackles the problem of statistical estimation of R(0) based on similar information, which was previously performed simply by counting the number of secondary transmissions regardless of time.","title":"Transmission potential of primary pneumonic plague: time inhomogeneous evaluation based on historical documents of the transmission network.","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: primary pneumonic plague\\r\\nlocation: Mukden, China\\r\\ndate: 1946\\r\\nR0 value: 2.8 to 3.5\\r\\n%CI values: The lower 95% confidence intervals of R(0) exceeded unity\\r\\nmethod: statistical estimation of R(0) based on similar information\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: primary pneumonic plague\\r\\nlocation: Madagascar\\r\\ndate: 1957\\r\\nR0 value: 2.8 to 3.5\\r\\n%CI values: The lower 95% confidence intervals of R(0) exceeded unity\\r\\nmethod: statistical estimation of R(0) based on similar information","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"primary pneumonic plague\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Mukden, China\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"1946\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.8 to 3.5\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"The lower 95% confidence intervals of R(0) exceeded unity\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"statistical estimation of R(0) based on similar information\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"primary pneumonic plague\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Madagascar\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"1957\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.8 to 3.5\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"The lower 95% confidence intervals of R(0) exceeded unity\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"statistical estimation of R(0) based on similar information\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"Yersinia pestis\\", \\"location\\": \\"Mukden, China (1946)\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.8 to 3.5\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"serial interval and likelihood based approach\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"Yersinia pestis\\", \\"location\\": \\"Madagascar (1957)\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"serial interval and likelihood based approach\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2006","cluster_id":"1245"},{"main_cord_uid":"wgwjwxjb","cord_uid":"wgwjwxjb","abstract":"In this work, a new compartmental mathematical model of COVID-19 pandemic has been proposed incorporating imperfect quarantine and disrespectful behavior of citizens towards lockdown policies, which are evident in most of the developing countries.

Several cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented 48-142 days after the initial infection and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than 1 year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalized individuals, a year for hospitalized individuals, and the effective reproduction number after lockdown ends is 1.2 (our worst-case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 387 000 infectious individuals and 125 000 daily new cases; threefold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggest that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown in June until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary wave. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection as immunity to reinfection is not permanent.

Although evidence suggests that masks help to curb the spread of the disease, there is little empirical research at the population level. We investigate the association between self-reported mask-wearing, physical distancing, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the USA, along with the effect of statewide mandates on mask uptake. METHODS: Serial cross-sectional surveys were administered via a web platform to randomly surveyed US individuals aged 13 years and older, to query self-reports of face mask-wearing. Survey responses were combined with instantaneous reproductive number (Rt) estimates from two publicly available sources, the outcome of interest. Measures of physical distancing, community demographics, and other potential sources of confounding (from publicly available sources) were also assessed. We fitted multivariate logistic regression models to estimate the association between mask-wearing and community transmission control (Rt<1). Additionally, mask-wearing in 12 states was evaluated 2 weeks before and after statewide mandates. FINDINGS: 378\xc3\u0192\xc2\xa2\xc3\u201a\xe2\u201a\xac\xc3\u201a\xcb\u2020207 individuals responded to the survey between June 3 and July 27, 2020, of which 4186 were excluded for missing data. We observed an increasing trend in reported mask usage across the USA, although uptake varied by geography. A logistic model controlling for physical distancing, population demographics, and other variables found that a 10% increase in self-reported mask-wearing was associated with an increased odds of transmission control (odds ratio 3\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb753, 95% CI 2\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb703-6\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb743). We found that communities with high reported mask-wearing and physical distancing had the highest predicted probability of transmission control. Segmented regression analysis of reported mask-wearing showed no statistically significant change in the slope after mandates were introduced; however, the upward trend in reported mask-wearing was preserved. INTERPRETATION: The widespread reported use of face masks combined with physical distancing increases the odds of SARS-CoV-2 transmission control. Self-reported mask-wearing increased separately from government mask mandates, suggesting that supplemental public health interventions are needed to maximise adoption and help to curb the ongoing epidemic.

FINDINGS: 331 COVID-19 cases distributed across the ten regions of Shenzhen were reported on Feb 7, 2020. In our basic scenario (R(0) of 2\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb768), mobility reduction of 20\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u015360% within the city had a notable effect on controlling COVID-19 spread: a flattening of the peak number of cases by 33% (95% UI 21\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u015342) and delay to the peak number by 2 weeks with a 20% restriction, 66% (48\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u015375) reduction and 4 week delay with a 40% restriction, and 91% (79\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u015395) reduction and 14 week delay with a 60% restriction. The effects of mobility restriction were increased when combined with reductions of 25% or 50% in transmissibility of the virus. In specific analyses of mobility restrictions for individuals with symptomatic infections and for high-risk regions, these measures also had substantial effects on reducing the spread of COVID-19. For example, the peak of the epidemic was delayed by 2 weeks if the proportion of individuals with symptomatic infections who could move freely was maintained at 20%, and by 4 weeks if two high-risk regions were locked down. The simulation results were also affected by various transmission parameters.

However, ICU occupancy thresholds at which action should be taken are often selected arbitrarily. We propose a quantitative approach using mathematical modeling to identify ICU occupancy thresholds at which mitigation should be triggered to avoid exceeding the ICU capacity available for COVID-19 patients. We used a stochastic compartmental model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease progression, including critical cases that would require intensive care. We calibrated the model for the United States city of Chicago using daily COVID-19 ICU and hospital census data between March and August 2020. We projected ICU occupancies from September to May 2021 under two possible levels of transmission increase. The effect of combined mitigation measures was modeled as a decrease in the transmission rate that took effect when projected ICU occupancy reached a specified threshold. We found that mitigation did not immediately eliminate the risk of exceeding ICU capacity. Delaying action by 7 days increased the probability of exceeding ICU capacity by 10-60% and this increase could not be counteracted by stronger mitigation. Even under modest transmission increase, a threshold occupancy no higher than 60% was required when mitigation reduced the reproductive number Rt to just below 1. At higher transmission increase, a threshold of at most 40% was required with mitigation that reduced Rt below 0.75 within the first two weeks after mitigation. Our analysis demonstrates a quantitative approach for the selection of ICU occupancy thresholds that considers parameter uncertainty and compares relevant mitigation and transmission scenarios. An appropriate threshold will depend on the location, number of ICU beds available for COVID-19, available mitigation options, feasible mitigation strengths, and tolerated durations of intensified mitigation.","title":"Modeling robust COVID-19 intensive care unit occupancy thresholds for imposing mitigation to prevent exceeding capacities","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"w94v2ozp","cord_uid":"w94v2ozp","abstract":"With the aim of studying the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Tuscany region of Italy during the first epidemic wave (February-June 2020), we define a compartmental model that accounts for both detected and undetected infections and assumes that only notified cases can die.

The confidence intervals are estimated by a parametric bootstrap procedure and a Global Sensitivity Analysis is performed to assess the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in the values of the fixed parameters. According to our results, the basic reproduction number drops from an initial value of 6.055 to 0 at the end of the national lockdown, then it grows again, but remaining under 1. At the beginning of the epidemic, the case and the infection fatality rates are estimated to be 13.1% and 2.3%, respectively. Among the parameters considered as fixed, the average time from infection to recovery for the not notified infected appears to be the most impacting one on the model estimates. The probability for an infected to be notified has a relevant impact on the infection fatality rate and on the shape of the epidemic curve.

We found that N influences both the maximum number of actively infected cases and the date on which the maximum number of actively infected cases is reached. The high effect of N on maximum actively infected cases and peak date suggests the necessity of isolating the infected cases in a small community. The protection rate and average quarantined time are most sensitive to the infected populations, with a summation of their first-order sensitivity indices greater than 0.585, and their interactions are also substantial, being 0.389 and 0.334, respectively.

Finally, we consider what would be the impact of partial lockdown (involving only the older population) and full lockdown (involving the entire population) on the number of deaths and cumulative infections.","title":"Lockdown measures and their impact on single- and two-age-structured epidemic model for the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico","annotator_investigating_R0":"0","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Mexico\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: -\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: comprehensive nonlinear ODE model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Mexico\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"comprehensive nonlinear ODE model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021","cluster_id":"102"},{"main_cord_uid":"jc0byl72","cord_uid":"jc0byl72","abstract":"Countries worldwide have adopted various strategies to minimize the socio-economic impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on epidemic trajectories of 25 highly developed countries and 10 US states in the (mobility reduction)-(reproduction number) plane we showed that delay in imposition of nation-wide quarantine elevates the number of infections and deaths, surge of which inevitably has to be suppressed by stringent and sustained lockdown. As a consequence, cumulative mobility reduction and population-normalized cumulative number of COVID-19-associated deaths are significantly correlated and this correlation increases with time. Overall, we demonstrated that, as long as epidemic suppression is the aim, the trade-off between the death toll and economic loss is illusory: high death toll correlates with deep and long-lasting lockdown causing a severe economic downturn.","title":"Pareto-based evaluation of national responses to COVID-19 pandemic shows that saving lives and protecting economy are non-trade-off objectives","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"80bn2wgd","cord_uid":"80bn2wgd","abstract":"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are founded to be effective to delay epidemic spread and to reduce the number of patients.

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical and economic value of a shutdown that is successful in \'flattening\' or \'squashing the curve\' in Germany. Methods: In the base case, the study compared a successful shutdown to a worst-case scenario with no ICU capacity left to treat COVID-19 patients. To this end, a decision model was developed using, e.g., information on age-specific fatality rates, ICU outcomes, and the herd protection threshold. The value of an additional life year was borrowed from new, innovative oncological drugs, as cancer reflects a condition with a similar morbidity and mortality burden in the general population in the short term as COVID-19. Results: A shutdown that is successful in \'flattening the curve\' is projected to yield an average health gain between 0.01 and 0.05 life years (0.1 to 0.6 months) per capita in the German population. The corresponding economic value ranges between \xc3\u201a\xe2\u201a\xac616 and \xc3\u201a\xe2\u201a\xac4797 per capita or, extrapolated to the total population, 1% to 12% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. A shutdown that is successful in \'squashing the curve\' is expected to yield a minimum health gain of 0.8 life years (0.9 months) per capita, corresponding to 19% of the GDP in 2019. Results are particularly sensitive to mortality data and the prevalence of undetected cases. Conclusion: A successful shutdown is forecasted to yield a considerable gain in life years in the German population.

Existing habitat-based models do not consider interspecies pathogen transmission, a primary route for emergence of new infectious diseases and reservoirs in wildlife and man. The modeling of interspecies transmission has the potential to provide more accurate predictions of disease persistence and emergence dynamics. The new models are motivated by our recent work on hantavirus in rodent communities in Paraguay. Our Paraguayan data illustrate the spatial and temporal overlap among rodent species, one of which is the reservoir species for Jabora virus and others which are spillover species. Disease transmission occurs when their habitats overlap. Two mathematical models, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model, are developed for spread of hantavirus between a reservoir and a spillover species. Analysis of a special case of the ODE model provides an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\u017e\xe2\u20ac\xba(0), such that if \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\u017e\xe2\u20ac\xba(0) < 1, then the pathogen does not persist in either population but if \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\u017e\xe2\u20ac\xba(0) > 1, pathogen outbreaks or persistence may occur. Numerical simulations of the CTMC model display sporadic disease incidence, a new behavior of our habitat-based model, not present in other models, but which is a prominent feature of the seroprevalence data from Paraguay. Environmental changes that result in greater habitat overlap result in more encounters among various species that may lead to pathogen outbreaks and pathogen establishment in a new host.","title":"A Habitat-Based Model for the Spread of Hantavirus Between Reservoir and Spillover Species","annotator_investigating_R0":"0","text_response":"disease name: Hantavirus\\r\\nlocation: Paraguay\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: -\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: System of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"Hantavirus\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Paraguay\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"System of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2009-10-01 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"op1bes33","cord_uid":"op1bes33","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Bluetongue is a serious disease of ruminants caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV). BTV is transmitted by biting midges (Culicoides spp.). Serological evidence from livestock and the presence of at least one competent vector species of Culicoides suggests that transmission of BTV is possible and may have occurred in Kazakhstan. METHODS: We estimated the risk of transmission using a mathematical model of the reproduction number R(0) for bluetongue. This model depends on livestock density and climatic factors which affect vector density. Data on climate and livestock numbers from the 2466 local communities were used. This, together with previously published model parameters, was used to estimate R(0) for each month of the year. We plotted the results on isopleth maps of Kazakhstan using interpolation to smooth the irregular data. We also mapped the estimated proportion of the population requiring vaccination to prevent outbreaks of bluetongue. RESULTS: The results suggest that transmission of bluetongue in Kazakhstan is not possible in the winter from October to March. Assuming there are vector-competent species of Culicoides endemic in Kazakhstan, then low levels of risk first appear in the south of Kazakhstan in April before spreading north and intensifying, reaching maximum levels in northern Kazakhstan in July. The risk declined in September and had disappeared by October. CONCLUSION: These results should aid in surveillance efforts for the detection and control of bluetongue in Kazakhstan by indicating where and when outbreaks of bluetongue are most likely to occur. The results also indicate where vaccination efforts should be focussed to prevent outbreaks of disease.

Since then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform beyond the current public health dogma called \\"flatten-the-curve\\". There are several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases. Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data, these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19 pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates in epidemics. In addition to that, the presented modelling study provides a good framework for the creation of subexponential-growth-models for assessing the spread of COVID-19.","title":"COVID-19 mitigation strategies and overview on results from relevant studies in Europe","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"gfetl2xg","cord_uid":"gfetl2xg","abstract":"The Distributed Logistic Model and the Adaptive Logistic Model of epidemics are formulated and used to study the course of cases and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The effective reproduction number R(e)(t) is a critical measure of epidemic potential. R(e)(t) can be calculated in near real time using an incidence time series and the generation time distribution: the time between infection events in an infector-infectee pair. In calculating R(e)(t), the generation time distribution is often approximated by the serial interval distribution: the time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair. However, while generation time must be positive by definition, serial interval can be negative if transmission can occur before symptoms, such as in covid-19, rendering such an approximation improper in some contexts. Methods. We developed a method to infer the generation time distribution from parametric definitions of the serial interval and incubation period distributions. We then compared estimates of R(e)(t) for covid-19 in the Greater Toronto Area of Canada using: negative-permitting versus non-negative serial interval distributions, versus the inferred generation time distribution. Results. We estimated the generation time of covid-19 to be Gamma-distributed with mean 3.99 and standard deviation 2.96 days. Relative to the generation time distribution, non-negative serial interval distribution caused overestimation of R(e)(t) due to larger mean, while negative-permitting serial interval distribution caused underestimation of R(e)(t) due to larger variance. Implications. Approximation of the generation time distribution of covid-19 with non-negative or negative-permitting serial interval distributions when calculating R(e)(t) may result in over or underestimation of transmission potential, respectively.","title":"Estimating effective reproduction number using generation time versus serial interval, with application to covid-19 in the Greater Toronto Area, Canada","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-11-01 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"pghy7llh","cord_uid":"pghy7llh","abstract":"This paper introduces a multigroup COVID-19 model with immunity, in which the total population of each group is partitioned into five compartments, that is, susceptible, exposed, infective, infective in treatment and recovered compartment.

Patients resident in the area covered by ATS-MI with symptom onset between February and May 2020 were selected. Different epidemic periods were considered based on the timeline of the various regional and national containment measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: case fatality ratios, incidence rates, and reproduction number by epidemic period and sub-area of ATS-MI. RESULTS: a total of 27,017 swab-positive COVID-19 cases were included. Mean age was 65 years and males were 45%. Incidence in the ATS-MI area was 776 per 100,000 population. The number of deaths was 4,660, the crude case fatality ratio was 17.3%, higher in males (21.2%) than in females (14.0%). The estimated reproduction number registered its peak (3.0) in the early stages of the epidemic and subsequently decreased.

The resulting disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019), soon became a pandemic. This study aims to characterize key attributes of the epidemiology of this infection in China. Methods: An age-stratified mathematical model was constructed to describe the transmission dynamics and estimate the age-specific differences in the biological susceptibility to the infection, age-assortativeness in transmission mixing, case fatality rate (CFR), and transition in rate of infectious contacts (and reproduction number R0) following introduction of mass interventions. Results: The model estimated the infectious contact rate in early epidemic at 0.59 contacts per day (95% uncertainty interval (UI)=0.48-0.71). Relative to those 60-69 years of age, susceptibility to the infection was only 0.06 in those \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa419 years, 0.34 in 20-29 years, 0.57 in 30-39 years, 0.69 in 40-49 years, 0.79 in 50-59 years, 0.94 in 70-79 years, and 0.88 in \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa580 years. The assortativeness in transmission mixing by age was very limited at 0.004 (95% UI=0.002-0.008). Final CFR was 5.1% (95% UI=4.8-5.4%). R0 rapidly declined from 2.1 (95% UI=1.8-2.4) to 0.06 (95% UI=0.05-0.07) following onset of interventions. Conclusion: Age appears to be a principal factor in explaining the patterns of COVID-19 transmission dynamics in China. The biological susceptibility to the infection seems limited among children, intermediate among young to mid-age adults, but high among those >50 years of age. There was no evidence for differential contact mixing by age, consistent with most transmission occurring in households rather than in schools or workplaces.","title":"Characterizing key attributes of the epidemiology of COVID-19 in China: Model-based estimations","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019)\\r\\nlocation: China\\r\\ndate: late 2019\\r\\nR0 value: 2.1\\r\\n%CI values: (95% UI=1.8-2.4)\\r\\nmethod: age-stratified mathematical model\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019)\\r\\nlocation: China\\r\\ndate: following onset of interventions\\r\\nR0 value: 0.06\\r\\n%CI values: (95% UI=0.05-0.07)\\r\\nmethod: age-stratified mathematical model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019)\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"China\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"late 2019\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.1\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% UI=1.8-2.4)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"age-stratified mathematical model\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019)\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"China\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"following onset of interventions\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"0.06\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% UI=0.05-0.07)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"age-stratified mathematical model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019)\\", \\"location\\": \\"China\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.1\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% UI=1.8-2.4)\\", \\"method\\": \\"age-stratified mathematical model\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019)\\", \\"location\\": \\"China\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"0.66\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% UI=0.05-0.07)\\", \\"method\\": \\"age-stratified mathematical model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020-04-11 00:00:00","action":"change_main_cord_id","cluster_id":"25"},{"main_cord_uid":"b03s7wsw","cord_uid":"b03s7wsw","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Ambulatory antibiotic prescriptions without a clinic visit or without documentation of infection could represent overuse and contribute to adverse outcomes. We aim to describe US ambulatory antibiotic prescribing, including those without an associated visit or infection diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted an observational cohort study using data of all patients receiving antibacterial, antibiotic prescriptions from 04-01-2016 to 06-30-2018, in a large US private health insurance plan. We identified outpatient antibiotic prescriptions as: (1) associated with a clinician visit and an infection-related diagnosis; (2) associated with a clinician visit, but no infection-related diagnosis; or (3) not associated with an in-person clinician visit in the seven days prior to the prescription (non-visit-based). We then assessed whether non-visit-based antibiotic prescriptions (NVBAP) differed from visit-based antibiotics by patient, clinician, or antibiotic characteristics using multivariable models. FINDINGS: The cohort included 8\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb76M enrollees who filled 22\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb73M antibiotic prescriptions. NVBAP accounted for 31%(6\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb79M) of fills and non-infection-related prescribing accounted for 22%(4\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb79M). NVBAP rates were lower for children than for adults (0-17 years old, 16%; 18-64 years old, 33%; > 65 years old, 34%). Among most commonly-prescribed antibiotic classes, NVBAP was highest for penicillins (36%), and lowest for cephalosporins (25%) and macrolides (25%). Specialist physicians had the highest rate of NVBAP (38%), followed by internists (28%), family medicine (20%), and pediatricians (10%). In multivariable models, NVBAP was associated with increasing age and NVBAP was less likely for patients in the South, with more baseline clinical visits, or with chronic lung disease. INTERPRETATION: Over half of ambulatory antibiotic use was either non-visit based or non-infection-related. Particularly given healthcare changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to improve antibiotic prescribing must account for non-visit-based and non-infection-related prescribing.

The mortality rate calculated turns out to be 9.19%,34.37% and 6.29% for SARS-2003, MERS-2012 and COVID-19 respectively. The basic reproduction rate R0 was 2-5 for SARS-2003, 0.3-0.8 for MERS-2012 and 1.4- 5.7 for COVID-19. We found out the relation between number of mutations and mortality as well as phylogenetic relations. High number of mutations corresponded to higher mortality rate as in countries like Italy and Spain. Alpha and Beta-coronaviruses show a common ancestor from which they descended. Brazil and Iran have shown similar phylogenetic descent explaining their mortality rate. India however showed a distant relation from the common ancestor of other genome sequences. This study highlights the mutations of the SARS-CoV2 virus as well as sets up a comparison with the previous outbreaks.

To address this issue, a new estimator is introduced that is asymptotically consistent, has a smaller estimation variance than the least squares estimator, and achieves the semiparametric efficiency.

A positive consequence of past epidemics and pandemics is that there are sound epidemiological compartmental modelling approaches that can effectively model disease spread. With minor changes to the underlying dynamical system of equations, many different strategies and situations can be explored. In particular, one such strategy of social distancing is top of mind for many Canadians as our political leaders, local businesses, and fellow Canadians promote and adopt this approach with the hopes that it will effectively \'flatten the curve\' and reduce or prevent further spread. In this paper, the baseline SIR model is introduced with its close counterpart, the SEIR model. Social distancing is modelled through the isolation of a subset of the susceptible population and comparative studies are performed considering a range in the proportion of individuals isolated. Robust and accurate numerical approximation techniques are used to simulate the pessimistic base case for which no preventative measures are taken and for various social distancing regimes. The results of social distancing are consolidated into two groups - those that flatten the curve and those that completely halt the disease spread. Mathematical formulations show that the turning point between these two regimes is when the effective reproductive rate, denoted Re, is equal to 1. Conclusions are made regarding the impacts and extent of the spread in relation to the severity of social distancing measures.","title":"A Study of the COVID-19 Impacts on the Canadian Population","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"ajdca6sj","cord_uid":"ajdca6sj","abstract":"Despite the adoption of a national immunization program in China, the incidence of mumps remains high.

In addition, the reasonable \xc3\u017d\xc2\xb2 and \xc3\u017d\xc2\xb3 estimates of the hospital were determined, and the spread of the epidemic in hospital was simulated, to discuss the impact of basal reproductive number changes, isolation, vaccination, and so forth on COVID-19. RESULTS: There was a certain gap between the fitting of SIR to the remover and the actual data. The fitting of the number of infections was accurate. The growth rate of the number of infections decreased after measures, such as isolation, were taken. The effect of herd immunity was achieved after the overall immunity reached 70.9%. CONCLUSION: The SIR model based on deep learning and the stochastic SIR fitting model were accurate in judging the development trend of the epidemic, which can provide basis and reference for hospital epidemic infection control.","title":"Susceptible-Infected-Removed Mathematical Model under Deep Learning in Hospital Infection Control of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-10-27 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"jpk03ap9","cord_uid":"jpk03ap9","abstract":"Given maximal social distancing duration and intensity, how can one minimize the epidemic final size, or equivalently the total number of individuals infected during the outbreak?

Based on the available non-pharmacological interventions like wearing of face masks, observing social distancing, and lockdown, this work assesses the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures (social distancing and use of face-masks) and mass testing on the transmission of COVID-19 in Nigeria. A mathematical model for COVID-19 is formulated with intervention measures (observing social distancing and wearing of face masks) and mass testing. The basic reproduction number, R_0, is computed using next-generation method while the disease-free equilibrium is found to be locally and globally asymptotically stable when R_0&lt; 1. The model is parameterized using Nigeria data on COVID-19 in Nigeria. The basic reproduction number is found to be less than unity (R_0 &lt; 1) either when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50% &lt;= alpha&lt; 70%) and the testing rate per day is moderate (0,5 &lt;=alpha_2 &lt; 0,7) or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict (alpha&gt;=70%) and the testing rate per day is poor (alpha_2 = 0,3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. However, it will be easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures in the presence of poor testing rate due to the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. Hence, this study advocates that Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while ensuring that all the citizens strictly comply with wearing face masks and observing social distancing in public.","title":"The role of mathematical model in curbing COVID-19 in Nigeria","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Nigeria\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: less than unity\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: next-generation method","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Nigeria\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"less than unity\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"next-generation method\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Nigeria\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"next-generation method\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020","cluster_id":"546"},{"main_cord_uid":"smznem1d","cord_uid":"smznem1d","abstract":"Pandemics, such as Covid-19 and AIDS, tend to be highly contagious and have the characteristics of global spread and existence of multiple virus strains.

Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. METHODS: We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in \xc3\u0192\xc5\xbdle-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing. RESULTS: We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints. CONCLUSIONS: As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.","title":"Impact of lockdown on COVID-19 epidemic in \xc3\u0192\xc5\xbdle-de-France and possible exit strategies","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: le-de-France\\r\\ndate: prior to lockdown\\r\\nR0 value: 3.18\\r\\n%CI values: [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval)\\r\\nmethod: stochastic age-structured transmission model\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: le-de-France\\r\\ndate: during lockdown\\r\\nR0 value: 0.68\\r\\n%CI values: [0.66, 0.69]\\r\\nmethod: stochastic age-structured transmission model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"le-de-France\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"prior to lockdown\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"3.18\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"[3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"stochastic age-structured transmission model\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"le-de-France\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"during lockdown\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"0.68\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"[0.66, 0.69]\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"stochastic age-structured transmission model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"u00b11.48\\", \\"date\\": \\"prior to lockdown\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"3.18\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"[3.09, 3.24]\\", \\"method\\": \\"stochastic age-structured transmission model\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"u00b11.48\\", \\"date\\": \\"during lockdown\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"0.68\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"[0.66, 0.69]\\", \\"method\\": \\"stochastic age-structured transmission model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020","cluster_id":"1397"},{"main_cord_uid":"pys3ueum","cord_uid":"pys3ueum","abstract":"In order to explore the intrinsic laws of the spread of COVID-19 across the globe, this paper applies partial differential equation and related theories to model and carry out theoretical analysis and numerical analysis.

Methods: In this study, the dynamics of COVID-19 in India and several of its selected states with different demographic structures were analyzed using the SEIRD epidemiological model. The basic reproductive ratio R0 was systemically estimated to predict the dynamics of the temporal progression of COVID-19 in India and eight of its states, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. Results: For India, the SEIRD model calculations show that the peak of infection is expected to appear around the middle of October, 2020. Furthermore, we compared the model scenario to a Gaussian fit of the daily infected cases and obtained similar results. The early imposition of a nation-wide lockdown has reduced the number of infected cases but delayed the appearance of the infection peak significantly.

Scientists have made strides in estimating key transmission and epidemiological parameters. In particular, accumulating evidence points to a substantial fraction of asymptomatic or subclinical infections, which influences our understanding of the transmission potential and severity of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. METHODS: We employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City together with epidemiological data of Japanese repatriated from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. RESULTS: Our posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China, in 2019-2020 reached values at 3.49 (95% CrI 3.39-3.62) with a mean serial interval of 6.0 days, and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23 in 2020 was associated with a significantly reduced R at 0.84 (95% CrI 0.81-0.88), with the total number of infections (i.e., cumulative infections) estimated at 1,906,634 (95% CrI 1,373,500-2,651,124) in Wuhan City, elevating the overall proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95% CrI 13.5-26.6%). We also estimated the most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR at 0.04% (95% CrI 0.03-0.06%) and 0.12% (95% CrI 0.08-0.17%), respectively, estimates that are substantially smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.06%. CONCLUSIONS: We have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, during January-February 2020 using an ecological modeling approach that is suitable to infer epidemiological parameters with quantified uncertainty from partial observations collected by surveillance systems. Our estimate of time-delay adjusted IFR falls in the range of the median IFR estimates based on multiple serological studies conducted in several areas of the world.","title":"Early epidemiological assessment of the transmission potential and virulence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan City, China, January-February, 2020","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Wuhan City, China\\r\\ndate: 2019-2020\\r\\nR0 value: 3.49\\r\\n%CI values: (95% CrI 3.39-3.62)\\r\\nmethod: statistical methods\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Wuhan City, China\\r\\ndate: after January 23 in 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 0.84\\r\\n%CI values: (95% CrI 0.81-0.88)\\r\\nmethod: statistical methods","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Wuhan City, China\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"2019-2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"3.49\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CrI 3.39-3.62)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"statistical methods\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Wuhan City, China\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"after January 23 in 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"0.84\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CrI 0.81-0.88)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"statistical methods\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Wuhan City, China\\", \\"date\\": \\"January-February, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"3.49\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CrI 3.39-3.62)\\", \\"method\\": \\"statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Wuhan City, China\\", \\"date\\": \\"January-February, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"0.84\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CrI 0.81-0.88)\\", \\"method\\": \\"statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020","cluster_id":"497"},{"main_cord_uid":"s2v7b4dv","cord_uid":"s2v7b4dv","abstract":"COVID-19 presents an urgent global challenge because of its contagious nature, frequently changing characteristics, and the lack of a vaccine or effective medicines. A model for measuring and preventing the continued spread of COVID-19 is urgently required to provide smart health care services.

This paper proposes a model for predicting COVID-19 using the SIR and machine learning for smart health care and the well-being of the citizens of KSA. Knowing the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered cases each day is critical for mathematical modeling to be able to identify the behavioral effects of the pandemic. It forecasts the situation for the upcoming 700 days. The proposed system predicts whether COVID-19 will spread in the population or die out in the long run. Mathematical analysis and simulation results are presented here as a means to forecast the progress of the outbreak and its possible end for three types of scenarios: \\"no actions,\\" \\"lockdown,\\" and \\"new medicines.\\" The effect of interventions like lockdown and new medicines is compared with the \\"no actions\\" scenario. The lockdown case delays the peak point by decreasing the infection and affects the area equality rule of the infected curves. On the other side, new medicines have a significant impact on infected curve by decreasing the number of infected people about time. Available forecast data on COVID-19 using simulations predict that the highest level of cases might occur between 15 and 30 November 2020. Simulation data suggest that the virus might be fully under control only after June 2021. The reproductive rate shows that measures such as government lockdowns and isolation of individuals are not enough to stop the pandemic. This study recommends that authorities should, as soon as possible, apply a strict long-term containment strategy to reduce the epidemic size successfully.","title":"Measuring and Preventing COVID-19 Using the SIR Model and Machine Learning in Smart Health Care","annotator_investigating_R0":"0","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: KSA\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: -\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: SIR and machine learning","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"KSA\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"SIR and machine learning\\"}}]","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"248x096x","cord_uid":"248x096x","abstract":"This report describes an ongoing R03 grant that explores the links between trait reward sensitivity, substance use, and neural responses to social and nonsocial reward.

We are investigating these questions via a neuroimaging study with college-aged participants, using individual difference measures that examine the relation between substance use, social context, and trait reward sensitivity with tasks that measure reward anticipation, strategic behavior, social reward consumption, and the influence of social context on reward processing. We predict that substance use will be tied to distinct patterns of striatal dysfunction. Specifically, reward hyposensitive individuals will exhibit blunted striatal responses to social and non-social reward and enhanced connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex; in contrast, reward hypersensitive individuals will exhibit enhanced striatal responses to social and non-social reward and blunted connectivity with the orbitofrontal cortex. We also will examine the relation between self-reported reward sensitivity, substance use, and striatal responses to social reward and social context. We predict that individuals reporting the highest levels of substance use will show exaggerated striatal responses to social reward and social context, independent of self-reported reward sensitivity. Examining corticostriatal responses to reward processing will help characterize the relation between reward sensitivity, social context and substance use while providing a foundation for understanding risk factors and isolating neurocognitive mechanisms that may be targeted to increase the efficacy of interventions.","title":"The Role of Social Reward and Corticostriatal Connectivity in Substance Use","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-10-29 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"xpy9el86","cord_uid":"xpy9el86","abstract":"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is one of the most concerning health problems around the globe.

Rapid progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the necessity of epidemic modeling studies to evaluate the course of the epidemic and its burden on the health system. This study aims to estimate the total number of infected people, evaluate the consequences of social interventions on the healthcare system and predict the expected number of cases, intensive care needs, hospitalizations and mortality rates in Turkey according to possible scenarios via the SEIR-based epidemic modeling method. Methods: This study was carried out in three dimensions. In the first, the actual number of people infected in the community has been estimated using the number of deaths in Turkey. In the second, the expected total numbers of infected people, total deaths, total hospitalizations, and intensive care unit (ICU) bed needs have been predicted in case of no intervention. In third, the distribution of the expected number of infected people and deaths, ICU and non-ICU bed needs over time has predicted based on SEIR modeling. A simulator (TURKSAS) has been developed and predictions made in 4 scenarios for Turkey. Results: According to deaths, the estimated number of infected people in Turkey on March 21 was 123,030. In the case of no intervention (1st scenario), the expected total number of infected people is 72,091,595, the total number of deaths is 445,956, the attack rate is 88.1%, the mortality ratio is 0.54%. The ICU bed capacity in Turkey is expected to exceed 4.4-fold and non-ICU bed capacity exceeds 3.21-fold. In 2nd and 3rd scenarios according to the calculations made by considering the social compliance rates of the NPIs, the value of R0 is estimated to decrease from 3 to 1.38 level. Compliance with NPIs makes a 94,303 difference in the expected number of deaths. In both scenarios, the predicted peak value of occupied ICU and non-ICU beds remains below Turkey healthcare capacity. While this study conducted, curfew for >65 and <20 age groups were in force in Turkey. If the curfew is declared for the 21-64 age population (4th scenario), the R0 value drops below 1 (0.98), the expected deaths are 14,230 and the peak values of daily ICU and non-ICU bed demand are below the healthcare capacity. Discussion: Modeling epidemics with assumptions supported by scientific literature and establishing decision support systems based on objective criteria is an important requirement. According to scientific data for the population of Turkey, the situation is not expected to be of worse than predictions presented in the second dimension. Predictions show that 16 million people can be prevented from being infected and 100,000 deaths can be prevented by full compliance with the measures taken. Complete control of the pandemic is possible by keeping R0 below 1. For this, additional evidence-based measures are needed.","title":"Nowcasting and Forecasting the Spread of COVID-19 and Healthcare Demand In Turkey, A Modelling Study","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Turkey\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 3\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: SEIR modeling\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Turkey\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 1.38\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: SEIR modeling 2nd scenario\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Turkey\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 1.38\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: SEIR modeling 3rd scenario\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Turkey\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 0.98\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: SEIR modeling 4th scenario","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Turkey\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"3\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"SEIR modeling\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Turkey\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.38\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"SEIR modeling 2nd scenario\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Turkey\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.38\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"SEIR modeling 3rd scenario\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Turkey\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"0.98\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"SEIR modeling 4th scenario\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Turkey\\", \\"date\\": \\"March 21\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"declined from 3 to 1.38\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"SEIR-based epidemic modeling method\\" } } ]","publish_time":"43938.41667","cluster_id":"715"},{"main_cord_uid":"xjufduyt","cord_uid":"xjufduyt","abstract":"Today, the world is fighting against a dangerous epidemic caused by the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.

Recent epidemiology research has concentrated on using different prediction models to estimate the numbers of infected, recovered, and deceased cases around the world. This study is primarily focused on evaluating two common prediction models: Susceptible - Infected - Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible - Exposed - Infected - Recovered (SEIR). The SIR and SEIR models were compared in estimating the outbreak and identifying the better fitting model for forecasting future spread in Kuwait. Based on the results of the comparison, the SEIR model was selected for predicting COVID-19 infected, recovered, and cumulative cases. The data needed for estimation was collected from official sites of the Kuwait Government between 24 February and 1 December 2020. This study presents estimated values for peak dates and expected eradication of COVID-19 in Kuwait. The proposed estimation model is simulated using the Python Programming language on the collected data. The simulation was performed with various basic reproduction numbers (between 5.2 and 3), the initial exposed population, and the incubation rate. The results show that the SEIR model was better suited than the SIR model for predicting both infection and recovery cases with [Formula: see text] values ranging from 3 to 4, [Formula: see text] = 80 and [Formula: see text] = 0.2.","title":"A Study on the Efficiency of the Estimation Models of COVID-19","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-06-11 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"er5ozxzl","cord_uid":"er5ozxzl","abstract":"Since December 2020, variants of COVID-19 (especially Delta and Omicron) appeared with different characteristics that influenced death and transmissibility emerged around the world. To address the novel dynamics of the disease, we propose a dynamical model of two strains, namely native and mutant, transmission dynamics with mutation and imperfect vaccination. It is also assumed that the recuperated individuals from the native strain can be infected with mutant strain through the direct contact with individual or contaminated surfaces or aerosols. We compute the basic reproduction number for each strain independently and take the maximum for $R_0$. We prove the nonexistence of backward bifurcation using the center manifold theory, and global stability of disease-free equilibrium when the basic reproduction number $R_0<1. An intermediate mutation rate $\\\\nu_1$ leads to oscillations. When $\\\\nu_1$ increases over a threshold, the system regains its stability and exhibits an interesting dynamics called endemic bubble. An analytical expression for vaccine-induced herd immunity is derived. The model is parameterized using the Indian data of the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 from March 1 to September 27 in 2021, using MCMC method. The cumulative cases and deaths can be reduced by increasing the vaccine efficacies to both native and mutant strains. We observe that by considering the vaccine efficacy to native strain as 90\\\\%, the cumulative cases and deaths would be reduced by 3.27\\\\% and 5.2\\\\%, respectively; and by considering the vaccine efficacy to mutant strain as 90\\\\%, the cumulative cases and deaths would be reduced by 0.9\\\\% and 2.5\\\\%, respectively. Our study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic may be worse due to the occurrence of oscillations for certain mutation rates but better due to stability at a lower infection level with a larger mutation rate.","title":"Mutations make pandemics worse or better: modeling SARS-CoV-2 variants and imperfect vaccination","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2022-01-17 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"1vf94lg0","cord_uid":"1vf94lg0","abstract":"The Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is an ongoing public health concern worldwide.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed social distancing (SD) as a prudent measure to contain the pandemic and, hence, governments have been enacting lockdowns of varied nature. These lockdowns, causing economic and social strain, warrant the development of quantitative models to optimally manage the pandemic. Similarly, extensive testing aids in early detection and isolation, hence containing the spread of the pandemic. Compartment epidemiology models have been used extensively in modeling such infectious diseases. This paper attempts to utilize the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model incorporating the SD, testing, and infectiousness of exposed and infectious compartments to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has put restrictions on the movement of people in different phases to ascertain SD. Time-dependent parameters based on the timeline of restrictions and testing in Saudi Arabia have been introduced to capture SD and testing. The arrived model has been validated through statistical tests. The [Formula: see text] (R naught), basic reproduction number, value has ranged between 0.6014 and 2.7860 with an average of 1.4904 and currently holds at 0.8952. In the absence of SD and testing measures, the model predicts the threshold herd immunity to be 69.31% and [Formula: see text] value as 3.26. Further, scenario analysis has been conducted for alleviating the SD measure. The results show that early lifting of all restrictions may undo all efforts in the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The current study aims to evaluate how mitigating interventions affected the epidemic process in the 30 largest metropolitan areas in the US and whether temperature played a role in the epidemic process. METHODS: Publicly available data for the time series of COVID-19 cases and deaths and weather were analyzed at the metropolitan level. The time-varying reproductive numbers (R(t)) based on retrospective moving average were used to explore the trends. Student t-tests were used to compare temperature and peak R(t) cross-sectionally. RESULTS: We found that virus transmissibility, measured by instantaneous reproduction number (R(t)), had declined since the end of March for all areas and almost all of them reached a R(t) of 1 or below after April 15, 2020. The timing of the main decline was concurrent with the implementation of mitigating interventions. However, the R(t)s remained around 1 for most areas since then and there were some small and short rebounds in some areas, suggesting a persistent epidemic in those areas when interventions were relaxed. Cities with warm temperature also tended to have a lower peak R(t) than that of cities with cold temperature. However, they were not statistically significant and large geographic variations existed. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive interventions might have mitigated the current pandemic of COVID-19, while temperature might have weak effects on the virus transmission. We may need to prepare for a possible return of the coronavirus outbreak.","title":"Impact of mitigating interventions and temperature on the instantaneous reproduction number in the COVID-19 pandemic among 30 US metropolitan areas","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-08-22 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"pz9lsaw6","cord_uid":"pz9lsaw6","abstract":"The relationship between epidemiology, mathematical modeling and computational tools allows to build and test theories on the development and battling of a disease. This PhD thesis is motivated by the study of epidemiological models applied to infectious diseases in an Optimal Control perspective, giving particular relevance to Dengue. Dengue is a subtropical and tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes, that affects about 100 million people per year and is considered by the World Health Organization a major concern for public health. The mathematical models developed and tested in this work, are based on ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics underlying the disease, including the interaction between humans and mosquitoes. An analytical study is made related to equilibrium points, their stability and basic reproduction number. The spreading of Dengue can be attenuated through measures to control the transmission vector, such as the use of specific insecticides and educational campaigns. Since the development of a potential vaccine has been a recent global bet, models based on the simulation of a hypothetical vaccination process in a population are proposed. Based on Optimal Control theory, we have analyzed the optimal strategies for using these controls, and respective impact on the reduction/eradication of the disease during an outbreak in the population, considering a bioeconomic approach. The formulated problems are numerically solved using direct and indirect methods. The first discretize the problem turning it into a nonlinear optimization problem. Indirect methods use the Pontryagin Maximum Principle as a necessary condition to find the optimal curve for the respective control. In these two strategies several numerical software packages are used.","title":"Optimal Control and Numerical Optimization Applied to Epidemiological Models","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2014-01-29 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"dy2tige9","cord_uid":"dy2tige9","abstract":"In this article, we develop a mathematical model considering susceptible, exposed, infected, asymptotic, quarantine/isolation and recovered classes as in case of COVID-19 disease.

Many countries have implemented social distancing as a measure to control further spread. Methods: We evaluate whether and under which conditions containment or slowing down COVID-19 epidemics are possible by isolation and contact tracing in settings with various levels of social distancing. We use a stochastic transmission model in which every person generates novel infections according to a probability distribution that is affected by the incubation period distribution (time from infection to symptoms), distribution of the latent period (time from infection to onset of infectiousness), and overall transmissibility. The model distinguishes between close contacts (e.g., within a household) and other contacts in the population. Social distancing affects the number of contacts outside but not within the household. Findings: The proportion of asymptomatic or unascertained cases has a strong impact on the controllability of the disease. If the proportion of asymptomatic infections is larger than 30%, contact tracing and isolation cannot achieve containment for an R0 of 2.5. Achieving containment by social distancing requires a reduction of numbers of non-household contacts by around 90%. Depending on the realized level of contact reduction, tracing and isolation of only household contacts, or of household and non-household contacts are necessary to reduce the effective reproduction number to below 1. A combination of social distancing with isolation and contact tracing leads to synergistic effects that increase the prospect of containment. Interpretation: Isolation and contact tracing can be an effective means to slow down epidemics, but only if the majority of cases are ascertained. In a situation with social distancing, contact tracing can act synergistically and tip the scale towards containment, and can therefore be a tool for controlling COVID-19 epidemics as part of an exit strategy from current lockdown measures.","title":"Isolation and contact tracing can tip the scale to containment of COVID-19 in populations with social distancing","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-03-13 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"eb8ysg2b","cord_uid":"eb8ysg2b","abstract":"We propose a mathematical model to simulate the SARS outbreak in Beijing.

People are eager to know when the epidemic will be completely controlled and when people\'s work and life will be on the right track. Method: In this study we analyzed the epidemic dynamics and trend of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan by using the data after the closure of Wuhan city till February 12, 2020 based on the SEIR modeling method. Results: The optimal parameters were estimated as R0 = 1.44 (interquartile range: 1.40-1.47), TI = 14 (interquartile range = 14-14) and TE = 3.0 (interquartile range = 2.8-3.1).

Once entering March, the epidemic would gradually decline, and end around the late March. It is worth noting that the above prediction is based on the assumption that the number of susceptible population N = 200 000 will not increase. If the epidemic situation is not properly controlled, the peak of infected number can be further increased and the peak time will be a little postponed. It was expected that the epidemic would subside in early March, and disappear gradually towards the late March. Conclusions: The epidemic situation of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan was effectively controlled after the closure of the city, and the disease transmission index also decreased significantly.

On short timescales, super-spreading events lead to burstiness and overdispersion, while long-term persistent heterogeneity in susceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in the infection peak and the herd immunity threshold (HIT). Here, we develop a general approach to encompass both timescales, including time variations in individual social activity, and demonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of epidemiological models through parameterization. We derive a non-linear dependence of the effective reproduction number Re on the susceptible population fraction S. We show that a state of transient collective immunity (TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the epidemic. However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing levels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of herd immunity: subsequent waves can and will emerge due to behavioral changes in the population, driven (e.g.) by seasonal factors. Transient and long-term levels of heterogeneity are estimated by using empirical data from the COVID-19 epidemic as well as from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results suggest that the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, have achieved TCI following the first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT. Thus, in contrast to some previous claims, these regions can still experience subsequent waves.","title":"Time-dependent heterogeneity leads to transient suppression of the COVID-19 epidemic, not herd immunity","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"5t08uwkz","cord_uid":"5t08uwkz","abstract":"Background COVID-19 spread may have a dramatic impact in countries with vulnerable economies and limited availability of, and access to, healthcare resources and infrastructures. However, in sub-Saharan Africa a low prevalence and mortality have been observed so far. Methods We collected data on individual social contacts in Ethiopia across geographical contexts characterized by heterogeneous population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to primary care. We assessed how socio-demographic factors and observed mixing patterns can influence the COVID-19 disease burden, by simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in remote settlements, rural villages, and urban neighborhoods, under the current school closure mandate. Results From national surveillance data, we estimated a net reproduction number of 1.62 (95%CI 1.55-1.70). We found that, at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone, 10-15% of the overall population would have been symptomatic and 0.3-0.4% of the population would require mechanical ventilation and/or possibly result in a fatal outcome. Higher infection attack rates are expected in more urbanized areas, but the highest incidence of critical disease is expected in remote subsistence farming settlements. Conclusions The relatively low burden of COVID-19 in Ethiopia can be explained by the estimated mixing patterns, underlying demography and the enacted school closures.

We aimed to assess household transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility to infection in Wuhan. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included the households of all laboratory-confirmed or clinically confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections identified by the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention between Dec 2, 2019, and April 18, 2020. We defined households as groups of family members and close relatives who did not necessarily live at the same address and considered households that shared common contacts as epidemiologically linked. We used a statistical transmission model to estimate household secondary attack rates and to quantify risk factors associated with infectivity and susceptibility to infection, accounting for individual-level exposure history. We assessed how intervention policies affected the household reproductive number, defined as the mean number of household contacts a case can infect. FINDINGS: 27\xc3\u0192\xc2\xa2\xc3\u201a\xe2\u201a\xac\xc3\u201a\xcb\u2020101 households with 29\xc3\u0192\xc2\xa2\xc3\u201a\xe2\u201a\xac\xc3\u201a\xcb\u2020578 primary cases and 57\xc3\u0192\xc2\xa2\xc3\u201a\xe2\u201a\xac\xc3\u201a\xcb\u2020581 household contacts were identified. The secondary attack rate estimated with the transmission model was 15\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb76% (95% CI 15\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb72-16\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb70), assuming a mean incubation period of 5 days and a maximum infectious period of 22 days. Individuals aged 60 years or older were at a higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 than all other age groups. Infants aged 0-1 years were significantly more likely to be infected than children aged 2-5 years (odds ratio [OR] 2\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb720, 95% CI 1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb740-3\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb744) and children aged 6-12 years (1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb753, 1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb701-2\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb734). Given the same exposure time, children and adolescents younger than 20 years of age were more likely to infect others than were adults aged 60 years or older (1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb758, 1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb728-1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb795). Asymptomatic individuals were much less likely to infect others than were symptomatic cases (0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb721, 0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb714-0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb731). Symptomatic cases were more likely to infect others before symptom onset than after (1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb742, 1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb730-1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb755). After mass isolation of cases, quarantine of household contacts, and restriction of movement policies were implemented, household reproductive numbers declined by 52% among primary cases (from 0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb725 [95% CI 0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb724-0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb726] to 0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb712 [0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb710-0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb713]) and by 63% among secondary cases (from 0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb717 [0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb716-0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb718] to 0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb7063 [0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb7057-0\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb7070]). INTERPRETATION: Within households, children and adolescents were less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection but were more infectious than older individuals. Presymptomatic cases were more infectious and individuals with asymptomatic infection less infectious than symptomatic cases. These findings have implications for devising interventions for blocking household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, such as timely vaccination of eligible children once resources become available.

The aim of this paper is to offer a state-of-the-art review on neoadjuvant treatments in the setting of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science and Embase databases, in order to identify relevant studies published up to and including July 2021 that reported and analyzed the role of neoadjuvant therapy in the setting of pancreatic carcinoma. Most authors are concordant on the strong role of neoadjuvant therapy in the setting of borderline resectable pancreatic cancers. Recent randomized trials demonstrated improvement of R0 rate and survival after NAT in this setting. Patients with locally advanced cancers may become resectable after NAT, with better results than those obtained with palliative therapies. Even in the setting of resectable cancers, NAT is being evaluated by ongoing randomized trials. Chemotherapy regimens in the setting of NAT and response to NAT are discussed. NAT has an important role in the multimodal treatment of patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. It has a role in patients with locally advanced tumors as it can allow surgical resection in a relevant proportion of patients. For resectable pancreatic cancers, the role of NAT is under evaluation by several randomized trials.","title":"Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-10-09 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"kqkn7imd","cord_uid":"kqkn7imd","abstract":"We present an epidemic model capable of describing key features of the Covid-19 pandemic.

We can estimate when sustained disease transmission will end in a population by calculating the population-specific basic reproduction number R_0, the expected number of secondary cases generated by an infected person in the absence of any interventions. The value of R_0 relates to a herd immunity threshold (HIT), which is given by 1-1/R_0. When the immune fraction of a population exceeds this threshold, sustained disease transmission becomes exponentially unlikely (barring mutations allowing SARS-CoV-2 to escape immunity). Here, we report state-level R_0 estimates obtained using Bayesian inference. Maximum a posteriori estimates range from 7.1 for New Jersey to 2.3 for Wyoming, indicating that disease transmission varies considerably across states and that reaching herd immunity will be more difficult in some states than others. R_0 estimates were obtained from compartmental models via the next-generation matrix approach after each model was parameterized using regional daily confirmed case reports of COVID-19 from 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020. Our R_0 estimates characterize infectiousness of ancestral strains, but they can be used to determine HITs for a distinct, currently dominant circulating strain, such as SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta (lineage B.1.617.2), if the relative infectiousness of the strain can be ascertained. On the basis of Delta-adjusted HITs, vaccination data, and seroprevalence survey data, we find that no state has achieved herd immunity as of 20-September-2021.","title":"Bayesian Inference of State-Level COVID-19 Basic Reproduction Numbers across the United States","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: New Jersey, United States\\r\\ndate: 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\r\\nR0 value: 7.1\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Bayesian inference\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Wyoming, United States\\r\\ndate: 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\r\\nR0 value: 2.3\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Bayesian inference","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"New Jersey, United States\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"7.1\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Bayesian inference\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Wyoming, United States\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.3\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Bayesian inference\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"United States\\", \\"date\\": \\"21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"7.1\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"compartmental models via the next-generation matrix\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Wyoming\\", \\"date\\": \\"21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.3\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"compartmental models via the next-generation matrix\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2021-09-28 00:00:00","cluster_id":"187"},{"main_cord_uid":"2lkkj1fk","cord_uid":"2lkkj1fk","abstract":"A SEIR model with an added fomite term is used to constrain the contribution of fomites to the spread of COVID-19 under the Spring 2020 lockdown in the UK.

In this work, we use stochastic simulations to investigate the consequences of a population\'s heterogeneity regarding connectivity and individual viral load levels. Therefore, we translate a COVID-19 ODE model to a stochastic multi-agent system. We use contact networks to model complex interaction structures and a probabilistic infection rate to model individual viral load variation. We observe a large dependency of the dispersion and dynamical evolution on the population\'s heterogeneity that is not adequately captured by point estimates, for instance, used in ODE models. In particular, models that assume the same clinical and transmission parameters may lead to different conclusions, depending on different types of heterogeneity in the population. For instance, the existence of hubs in the contact network leads to an initial increase of dispersion and the effective reproduction number, but to a lower herd immunity threshold (HIT) compared to homogeneous populations or a population where the heterogeneity stems solely from individual infectivity variations.","title":"Why ODE models for COVID-19 fail: Heterogeneity shapes epidemic dynamics","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-03-26 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"733e9ojg","cord_uid":"733e9ojg","abstract":"Mathematical and computational modeling approaches are increasingly used as quantitative tools in the analysis and forecasting of infectious disease epidemics.

There is little information about the spatial-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza in South America. Here we provide a quantitative description of the age-specific morbidity pandemic patterns across administrative areas of Peru. METHODS: We used daily cases of influenza-like-illness, tests for A/H1N1 influenza virus infections, and laboratory-confirmed A/H1N1 influenza cases reported to the epidemiological surveillance system of Peru\'s Ministry of Health from May 1 to December 31, 2009. We analyzed the geographic spread of the pandemic waves and their association with the winter school vacation period, demographic factors, and absolute humidity. We also estimated the reproduction number and quantified the association between the winter school vacation period and the age distribution of cases. RESULTS: The national pandemic curve revealed a bimodal winter pandemic wave, with the first peak limited to school age children in the Lima metropolitan area, and the second peak more geographically widespread. The reproduction number was estimated at 1.6\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u01532.2 for the Lima metropolitan area and 1.3\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u01531.5 in the rest of Peru. We found a significant association between the timing of the school vacation period and changes in the age distribution of cases, while earlier pandemic onset was correlated with large population size. By contrast there was no association between pandemic dynamics and absolute humidity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate substantial spatial variation in pandemic patterns across Peru, with two pandemic waves of varying timing and impact by age and region. Moreover, the Peru data suggest a hierarchical transmission pattern of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 driven by large population centers. The higher reproduction number of the first pandemic wave could be explained by high contact rates among school-age children, the age group most affected during this early wave.","title":"Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of the 2009 A/H1N1 Influenza Pandemic in Peru","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: 2009 A/H1N1 Influenza\\r\\nlocation: Peru, Lima metropolitan area\\r\\ndate: May 1 to December 31, 2009\\r\\nR0 value: 1.6-2.2\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: -\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: 2009 A/H1N1 Influenza\\r\\nlocation: Peru, rest of Peru\\r\\ndate: May 1 to December 31, 2009\\r\\nR0 value: 1.3-1.5\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: -","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"2009 A/H1N1 Influenza\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Peru, Lima metropolitan area\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"May 1 to December 31, 2009\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.6-2.2\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"-\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"2009 A/H1N1 Influenza\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Peru, rest of Peru\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"May 1 to December 31, 2009\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.3-1.5\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"-\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"2009 A/H1N1 influenza\\", \\"location\\": \\"Lima metropolitan area\\", \\"date\\": \\"May 1 to December 31, 2009\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.6-2.2\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"-\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"2009 A/H1N1 influenza\\", \\"location\\": \\"rest of Peru\\", \\"date\\": \\"May 1 to December 31, 2009\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.3-1.5\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"-\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2011-06-21 10:00:00","cluster_id":"1172"},{"main_cord_uid":"pgkblrw3","cord_uid":"pgkblrw3","abstract":"In February 2020, the exponential growth of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan city posed a huge economic burden to local medical systems. Consequently, Wuhan established Fangcang Shelter hospitals as a One Health approach for responding to and containing the COVID-19 outbreak by isolating and caring for mild-to-moderate cases. However, it is unclear to what degree the hospitals contained COVID-19. This study performed an interrupted time series analysis to compare the number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 before and after the operation of Fangcang Shelter hospitals. The initial number of confirmed cases in Wuhan increased significantly by 68.54 cases per day prior to February 4, 2020. Compared with the number of cases noted 20 days before the use of Fangcang Shelter hospitals, a sustained reduction in the number of confirmed cases (trend change, \xc3\xa2\xcb\u2020\xe2\u20ac\u2122125.57; P < 0.0001) was noted 41 days after the use of the hospitals. Immediate-level changes were observed for confirmed cases (level change, 725.97; P = 0.025). These changes led to an estimated 5148 fewer confirmed cases (P < 0.0001). According to the mean confirmed cases of 395.71 per day before the intervention, we estimated that Wuhan had advanced the terminal phase of COVID-19 by 13 days. Furthermore, immediately after introduction of Fangcang Shelter Hospitals on February 5, the reproduction number dropped rapidly, from a pre-introduction rate of 4.0 to 2.0.

The virus has taken spread in India as well, whereas of June 13, 2020, 3,09,603 cases are confirmed with 8,890 deaths and 1,54,330 recovery. It this situation, it is vital to know the potential danger posed by the pandemic and the epidemic trajectory. In this paper, the basic reproduction number (R0 ) of COVID-19 from the early epidemic data in India is estimated. The course of the pandemic in India as well as the worst affected seven states in India, namely Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and West Bengal is also analyzed. The early outbreak data from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India, are collected for the analysis.

The results show that R0 varies from 1.53 to 3.25 accounting to different methodologies and serial intervals adopted, whereas WHO estimations are from 2 to 2.5. Due to effect of lockdown, the time-dependent reproduction number has reduced to near about 1.22. It is predicted that by July 15, cumulative number of COVID-19 cases may reach around 1.2 million if the current effective reproduction number remains same over the next one month. Finally, it can be concluded that in the coming months, the novel coronavirus will pose a severe challenge to the Indian healthcare system. Thus, it is necessary to predict how the virus may spread so that the healthcare system may be prepared in advance.

DESIGN: We developed a Bayesian model to infer incident cases and reproduction number (R) in England, from incident death data. We then used this to forecast excess cases and deaths in multiple plausible scenarios in which R increases at one or more time points. SETTING: England. PARTICIPANTS: Publicly available national incident death data for COVID-19 were examined. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Excess cumulative cases and deaths forecast at 90 days, in simulated scenarios of plausible increases in R after successive easing of lockdown in England, compared with a baseline scenario where R remained constant. RESULTS: Our model inferred an R of 0.75 on 13 May when England first started easing lockdown. In the most conservative scenario modelled where R increased to 0.80 as lockdown was eased further on 1 June and then remained constant, the model predicted an excess 257 (95% CI 108 to 492) deaths and 26 447 (95% CI 11 105 to 50 549) cumulative cases over 90 days. In the scenario with maximal increases in R (but staying \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa41), the model predicts 3174 (95% CI 1334 to 6060) excess cumulative deaths and 421 310 (95% CI 177 012 to 804 811) cases. Observed data from the forecasting period aligned most closely to the scenario in which R increased to 0.85 on 1 June, and 0.9 on 4 July. CONCLUSIONS: When levels of transmission are high, even small changes in R with easing of lockdown can have significant impacts on expected cases and deaths, even if R remains \xc3\xa2\xe2\u20ac\xb0\xc2\xa41. This will have a major impact on population health, tracing systems and healthcare services in England.

Testing, contact tracing, and isolating/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase it takes longer to reach each cases\' contacts, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between cases, delays, and participation and the pathogen reproductive number Rt. We also examined implications for infection dynamics using a stochastic compartment model of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Rt increases sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because Rt increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing Rt (but minimizing total infections is more complicated). We also found that contact tracing quickly becomes ineffective in reducing Rt with increasing delays between symptom onset and tracing and with lower fraction of symptomatic infections being tested. Finally, we found that when cases are low, testing and tracing reductions in Rt can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, in which a small fraction of infections often give rise to most of transmission. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases. They also emphasize the value of easy access, high testing capacity and rapid turn-around of testing results, as well as outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic infections to be tested immediately after symptom onset. An efficient and adaptive public health capacity strategy can allow for increased economic activity and should be employed in the current and future pandemics.","title":"Contact tracing efficiency, transmission heterogeneity, and accelerating COVID-19 epidemics","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-09-07 10:00:00","cluster_id":"679"},{"main_cord_uid":"2xl0gp1o","cord_uid":"2xl0gp1o","abstract":"Since the detection of the first case of COVID-19 in Chile on March 3(rd), 2020, a total of 513,188 cases, including ~14,302 deaths have been reported in Chile as of November 2(nd), 2020.

METHODS: Two mitigation scenarios of SD for 1 month and continuous SD were compared with the baseline (no intervention). A modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model accounting for disease spread during the latent period was applied by considering a 1-year time horizon. The costs of healthcare, school closures, and productivity loss due to disease as well as intervention were considered to estimate the total pandemic cost among all scenarios. RESULTS: In a comparison with the baseline, the result showed that total savings in scenarios of SD for 1 month and continuous SD was approximately $415 billion and $699 billion, respectively, while the averted deaths were 4.6 million and 8.5 million, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that basic reproduction number, infectious period, daily wage, incubation period, daily ICU admission cost, and case fatality rate were the most influential parameters affecting the savings and the number of averted deaths.

The trial functions of model parameters show that the basic reproduction number was closed to unity over a wide range, the first from 100 to 365 days of the current pandemic in Canada. The proposed prediction models, based on influence of previous time and social economic policy, show excellent agreement with the data. The test results revel that the single path prediction can forecast a period of 30 days, and forecasting using previous social and economical situation can forecast a range of 55 days.","title":"A hybrid approach to predict COVID-19 cases using neural networks and inverse problem","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Canada\\r\\ndate: from 100 to 365 days of the current pandemic in Canada\\r\\nR0 value: closed to unity over a wide range\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: second order nonlinear differential equation for the total confirmed cases from a SIR-like model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Canada\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"from 100 to 365 days of the current pandemic in Canada\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"closed to unity over a wide range\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"second order nonlinear differential equation for the total confirmed cases from a SIR-like model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Canada\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"a combination of neural networks and inverse problem\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2022-05-17 00:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"eg8p2030","cord_uid":"eg8p2030","abstract":"Community quarantine has been resorted to by various governments to address the current COVID-19 pandemic; however, this is not the only non-therapeutic method of effectively controlling the spread of the infection.

Here we study the effect of major interventions across 11 European countries for the period from the start of the COVID-19 epidemics in February 2020 until 4 May 2020, when lockdowns started to be lifted. Our model calculates backwards from observed deaths to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks previously, allowing for the time lag between infection and death. We use partial pooling of information between countries, with both individual and shared effects on the time-varying reproduction number (Rt). Pooling allows for more information to be used, helps to overcome idiosyncrasies in the data and enables more-timely estimates. Our model relies on fixed estimates of some epidemiological parameters (such as the infection fatality rate), does not include importation or subnational variation and assumes that changes in Rt are an immediate response to interventions rather than gradual changes in behaviour. Amidst the ongoing pandemic, we rely on death data that are incomplete, show systematic biases in reporting and are subject to future consolidation. We estimate that-for all of the countries we consider here-current interventions have been sufficient to drive Rt below 1 (probability Rt < 1.0 is greater than 99%) and achieve control of the epidemic. We estimate that across all 11 countries combined, between 12 and 15 million individuals were infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to 4 May 2020, representing between 3.2% and 4.0% of the population.

The reproductive number (R) is a metric to estimate the transmission of a pathogen during an outbreak. Preliminary published estimates were based on the initial outbreak in China. Whole genome sequences (WGS) analysis found mutational variations in the viral genome; however, previous comparisons failed to show a direct relationship between viral genome diversity, transmission, and the epidemic severity. COVID-19 incidences from different countries were modeled over the epidemic curve. Estimates of the instantaneous R (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval were done. WGS were used to determine the populations genomic variation and that underpinned creation of the pathogen genome identity (GENI) score, which was merged with the outbreak curve in four distinct phases. Inference of transmission time was based on a mutation rate of 2 mutations/month. R estimates revealed differences in the transmission and variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak progression for each country examined. Outside China, our R estimates observed propagating dynamics indicating that other countries were poised to move to the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had no clear relationship to the outbreak progression. Integration of incidence data with the GENI score directly predicted increases in cases as the genome variation increased that led to new variants. Integrating the outbreak curve, dynamic R, and SNP variation found a direct association between increasing cases and transmission genome evolution. By defining the epidemic curve into four stages and integrating the instantaneous country-specific R with the GENI score, we directly connected changes in individual outbreaks based on changes in the virus genome via SNPs. This resulted in the ability to forecast potential increases in cases as well as mutations that may defeat PCR screening and the infection process. By using instantaneous R estimations and WGS, outbreak dynamics were defined to be linked to viral mutations, indicating that WGS, as a surveillance tool, is required to predict shifts in each outbreak that will provide actionable decision making information. Integrating epidemiology with genome sequencing and modeling allows for evidence-based disease outbreak tracking with predictive therapeutically valuable insights in near real time.","title":"Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomic epidemiology reveals disease transmission coupled to variant emergence and allelic variation","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"vm8bq4eo","cord_uid":"vm8bq4eo","abstract":"This paper provides estimates of COVID-19 effective reproduction numbers worldwide and explains their evolution for selected European countries since the start of the pandemic, taking account of changes in voluntary and government-mandated social distancing, incentives to comply, vaccination and the emergence of mutations.

In an epidemic, models can be used for the analysis of the spread of a disease, forecasting, identifying trends and making parameter estimates which can be used for planning and implementing intervention measures. Methods This study utilizes the classical Susceptible - Infected - Recovered (SIR) model to analyze the evolution of COVID-19 in Zambia during the third wave of infections. The model is fitted to actual COVID-19 data for Zambia for the third wave of the pandemic obtained from the Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI). The transmission and recovery rates are estimated by minimizing the error between the fitted curve and the real data using the least square approach. Results Model simulations indicate that the basic reproductive number (\\\\({R}_{0}\\\\)) for Zambia is 1.31 meaning that, on average, 1.31 persons are infected for each infected person. At the worst point of the epidemic, we expect that 591,743 people will contract the virus and 7,144 fatalities will be recorded. To prevent the spread of infection, the model estimates that at least 24 percent of the population will need to be vaccinated. With the country\'s projected population of about 18.91 million, this translates to roughly 4.5 million people. Conclusion The severity of COVID-19 infection, hospitalizations, and deaths in Zambia is substantially higher than national testing data suggests, according to model projections. More modeling work is needed to acquire accurate estimates of the disease burden in society, to inform resource allocation, and to aid mitigation planning, especially in countries that may lack adequate national surveillance systems.","title":"Simulation of the Third Wave of COVID 19 Infections in Zambia using the SIR Model (preprint)/ en","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Zambia\\r\\ndate: for the third wave of the pandemic obtained from the Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI)\\r\\nR0 value: 1.31\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: classical Susceptible - Infected - Recovered (SIR) model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Zambia\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"for the third wave of the pandemic obtained from the Zambia National Public Health Institute (ZNPHI)\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.31\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"classical Susceptible - Infected - Recovered (SIR) model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Zambia\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.31\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"classical Susceptible - Infected - Recovered (SIR) model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"-"},{"main_cord_uid":"5dd89gnm","cord_uid":"5dd89gnm","abstract":"Since December 8, 2019, the spread of COVID-19 is increasing every day.

As evidence is emerging that these measures may have slowed the spread of the pandemic, it is important to assess the impact of any changes in strategy, including scenarios for school reopening and broader relaxation of social distancing. This work uses an individual-based model to predict the impact of a suite of possible strategies to reopen schools in the UK, including that currently proposed by the UK government. Methods We use Covasim, a stochastic agent-based model for transmission of COVID-19, calibrated to the UK epidemic. The model describes individuals\' contact networks stratified as household, school, work and community layers, and uses demographic and epidemiological data from the UK. We simulate a range of different school reopening strategies with a society-wide relaxation of lockdown measures and in the presence of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, to estimate the number of new infections, cumulative cases and deaths, as well as the effective reproduction number with different strategies. To account for uncertainties within the stochastic simulation, we also simulated different levels of infectiousness of children and young adults under 20 years old compared to older ages. Findings We found that with increased levels of testing of people (between 25% and 72% of symptomatic people tested at some point during an active COVID-19 infection depending on scenarios) and effective contact-tracing and isolation for infected individuals, an epidemic rebound may be prevented across all reopening scenarios, with the effective reproduction number (R) remaining below one and the cumulative number of new infections and deaths significantly lower than they would be if testing did not increase. If UK schools reopen in phases from June 2020, prevention of a second wave would require testing 51% of symptomatic infections, tracing of 40% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases. However, without such measures, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are likely to induce a secondary pandemic wave, as are other scenarios for reopening. When infectiousness of <20 year olds was varied from 100% to 50% of that of older ages, our findings remained unchanged. Interpretation To prevent a secondary COVID-19 wave, relaxation of social distancing including reopening schools in the UK must be implemented alongside an active large-scale population-wide testing of symptomatic individuals and effective tracing of their contacts, followed by isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed individuals. Such combined measures have a greater likelihood of controlling the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventing a large number of COVID-19 deaths than reopening schools and society with the current level of implementation of testing and isolation of infected individuals.","title":"Determining the optimal strategy for reopening schools, work and society in the UK: balancing earlier opening and the impact of test and trace strategies with the risk of occurrence of a secondary COVID-19 pandemic wave","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-06-01 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"6w1zqbax","cord_uid":"6w1zqbax","abstract":"The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has fast spread to over 200 countries and regions worldwide since its outbreak, while in March, Europe became the emerging epicentre.

The numbers of daily confirmed cases and total confirmed cases were extracted from the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation reports of WHO. We applied an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model to fit the epidemic trend and estimated corresponding epidemic features.

Two different viruses, 229E and OC43 were initially recognized. Because of difficulty in isolating them using standard techniques, many of the early studies of their occurrence were seroepidemiologic. They were confirmed to be worldwide in distribution, and, in the North Temperate Zone, mainly occurring in the winter season. With the development of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, two additional distinct viruses have been identified, HKU1 and NL63. The four viruses have now been recognized as important in the etiology of common respiratory infections, second only to the rhinoviruses. In 2002, a previously unrecognized betacoronavirus emerged from a zoonotic reservoir in Southern China and spread during the following year to several major cities of the world. The resulting illness was termed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) because of its potential lethality. More than 8,000 probable cases were reported during 2003, mainly from Hong Kong and mainland China, producing social and economic disruption in those areas affected. A constant feature of the outbreak was the importance of nosocomial spread. In spite of an estimated basic reproductive number higher than influenza, the outbreak was ended, in large part because of control of in-hospital transmission. In 2012, another betacoronavirus has emerged in the Arabian peninsula which is producing a somewhat similar illness, termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), also marked by extensive nosocomial transmission. The outcome of this emergence is currently unknown.","title":"Coronaviruses","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2014-02-27 00:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"7ws2kleo","cord_uid":"7ws2kleo","abstract":"Since the appearance of the first case of COVID-19 in Morocco on March, 02,2020, the cumulative number of reported infectious cases continues to increase and, up to date, the peak-time of infection is not reached yet. In this study, we propose a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious deterministic model to evaluate the impact of compulsory containment imposed in Morocco on March, 21 on the spread of COVID-19 epidemic across the country. The model takes account of the unconfined individuals that continue to work or to leave their home for urgent needs and the existence of infectious asymptomatic and unreported individuals within susceptible population. Furthermore, the model is able to predict the peak-size, peak-time, final size and epidemic duration according to different rates of containment. Advanced knowledge of these details will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control or eradicate the epidemic. Indeed, mitigating and delaying the epidemic peak allow the official health authorities to anticipate and control the spread of COVID-19. Moreover, prediction of the epidemic duration can help the government to predict the end time of containment to avoid consequent social-economic damages as well. Using our model, the basic reproduction number R(0) is estimated to be 2.9949, with [Formula: see text] reflecting a high speed of spread of the epidemic. The model shows that the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. In the absence of other efficient measure of control, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July, 4,2020 with 7558 final cumulative cases. Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, has been determined. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is performed and showed that the COVID-19 dynamics strongly depends on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our previsions can help the government to adjust its plan-of-action to fight the disease and to face the social-economic shock induced by the containment.","title":"Impact assessment of containment measure against COVID-19 spread in Morocco","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Morocco\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 2.9949\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious deterministic model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Morocco\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.9949\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious deterministic model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Morocco\\", \\"date\\": \\"March, 21\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.9949\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious deterministic model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020-08-22 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"z16o1tps","cord_uid":"z16o1tps","abstract":"Given the worldwide pandemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its continuing threat brought by the emergence of virus variants, there are great demands for accurate surveillance and monitoring of outbreaks.

Ideally Rt should be less than 1 to keep the pandemic under control and our model predicts many of these factors contributed significantly to the Rt: Post-lockdown opening of the restaurants and nightclubs contributed 0.04 (CI 0.04-0.04) and 0.11 (CI. 0.11-0.11) to Rt. The mask mandates helped reduce Rt by 0.28 (CI 0.28-0.29)), whereas the testing rates which may have influenced the number of infections observed, did not influence Rt beyond 10,000 daily tests 0.07 (CI -0.57-0.42).

Findings: We estimated a weighted mean SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 2.88% (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.76-3.00), with a within-round reproduction number (R) overall of 0.94 (0.91-0.96). While within-round weighted prevalence fell among children (aged 5 to 17 years) and adults aged 18 to 54 years, we observed a level or increasing weighted prevalence among those aged 55 years and older with an R of 1.04 (1.00-1.09). Among 1,195 positive samples with sublineages determined, only one (0.1% [0.0-0.5]) corresponded to AY.39 Delta sublineage and the remainder were Omicron: N=390, 32.7% (30.0-35.4) were BA.1; N=473, 39.6% (36.8-42.5) were BA.1.1; and N=331, 27.7% (25.2-30.4) were BA.2. We estimated an R additive advantage for BA.2 (vs BA.1 or BA.1.1) of 0.40 (0.36-0.43). The highest proportion of BA.2 among positives was found in London.

The disease swept through Lombardy, which remained in lockdown for about two months, starting from the 8th of March. As of that day, the isolation measures taken in Lombardy were extended to the entire country. Here, assuming that effectively there was one case \\"zero\\" that introduced the virus to the region, we provide estimates for: (a) the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, Italy; (b) the actual number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population until March 8; (c) the basic (R0)and the effective reproduction number (Re) based on the estimation of the actual number of infected cases. To demonstrate the efficiency of the model and approach, we also provide a tentative forecast two months ahead of time, i.e. until May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced, on the basis of the COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports released by Google on March 29. METHODS: To deal with the uncertainty in the number of the actual asymptomatic infected cases in the total population Volpert et al. (2020), we address a modified compartmental Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infectious Asymptomatic/ Infected Symptomatic/ Recovered/ Dead (SEIIRD) model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the \\"effective\\" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator to fit the numbers of new daily cases from February 21 to the 8th of March. This was accomplished by solving a mixed-integer optimization problem. Based on the computed parameters, we also provide an estimation of the basic reproduction number R0 and the evolution of the effective reproduction number Re. To examine the efficiency of the model and approach, we ran the simulator to \\"forecast\\" the epidemic two months ahead of time, i.e. from March 8 to May 4. For this purpose, we considered the reduction in mobility in Lombardy as released on March 29 by Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports, and the effects of social distancing and of the very strict measures taken by the government on March 20 and March 21, 2020. RESULTS: Based on the proposed methodological procedure, we estimated that the expected day-zero was January 14 (min-max rage: January 5 to January 23, interquartile range: January 11 to January 18). The actual cumulative number of asymptomatic infected cases in the total population in Lombardy on March 8 was of the order of 15 times the confirmed cumulative number of infected cases, while the expected value of the basic reproduction number R0 was found to be 4.53 (min-max range: 4.40- 4.65). On May 4, the date on which relaxation of the measures commenced the effective reproduction number was found to be 0.987 (interquartiles: 0.857, 1.133). The model approximated adequately two months ahead of time the evolution of reported cases of infected until May 4, the day on which the phase I of the relaxation of measures was implemented over all of Italy.

This is important because sleep and physical activity are interrelated and promote health, and well-being. This study examined whether changes to physical activity were related to changes to sleep health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants were asked to estimate the number of minutes per day they engaged in physical activity during the pandemic, as well as before. These were subtracted from each other, and a difference score was computed. Then, responses were categorized as no change (<=15 mins difference), 16-45 minutes more or less activity, or 46+ minutes more or less activity (5 categories total). Outcome variables included the degree to which participants believed that due to the pandemic, they experienced (1) more schedule regularity, (2) better sleep, (3) worse sleep, (4) more difficulty falling asleep, (5) more difficulty maintaining sleep, (6) more sleepiness, and (7) more napping. Ordinal regressions were adjusted for age, and sex. RESULTS: Those who increased their activity by over 45 minutes per day reported that they were less likely to experience more daytime sleepiness (oOR=0.28, p<0.02). Those who decreased their activity by over 45 minutes per day reported that they were more likely to experience worse sleep (oOR=2.38, p<0.01) and less likely to experience a more regular schedule (oOR=0.37, p<0.003) than prior to the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Overall, those who increased their physical activity since the beginning of the pandemic reported less daytime sleepiness; and those who decreased their physical activity reported worse sleep experiences and a more irregular schedule. The relationship between physical activity and sleep during the pandemic may be bidirectional.

In this manuscript, we describe a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics. The proposed method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), applies a linear noise approximation to describe the size of the fluctuations, and uses each new surveillance observation to update the belief about the true epidemic state. Using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen, we evaluate the accuracy of MSS for real-time parameter estimation and prediction during epidemics. We assume that weekly counts for the number of new diagnosed cases are available and serve as an imperfect proxy of incidence. We show that MSS produces accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters (i.e. mean duration of infectiousness, R(0), and R(eff)) and can provide an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also allows for accurate prediction of the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. We compare the performance of MSS to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods: 1) a likelihood approximation with an assumption of independent Poisson observations; 2) a particle filtering method; and 3) an ensemble Kalman filter method. We find that MSS significantly outperforms each of these three benchmark methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. In summary, MSS is a promising method that may improve on current approaches for calibration and prediction using stochastic models of epidemics.","title":"A Likelihood Approach for Real-Time Calibration of Stochastic Compartmental Epidemic Models","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2017-01-17 00:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"qrm25ia3","cord_uid":"qrm25ia3","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus disease COVID-19 began in December 2019 and has spread rapidly by human-to-human transmission. This study evaluated the transmissibility of the infectious disease and analyzed its association with temperature and humidity to study the propagation pattern of COVID-19. METHODS: In this study, we revised the reported data in Wuhan based on several assumptions to estimate the actual number of confirmed cases considering that perhaps not all cases could be detected and reported in the complex situation there. Then we used the equation derived from the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model to calculate R(0) from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in 11 major cities in China for comparison. With the calculation results, we conducted correlation analysis and regression analysis between R(0) and temperature and humidity for four major cities in China to see the association between the transmissibility of COVID-19 and the weather variables. RESULTS: It was estimated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases had exceeded 45 000 by February 13, 2020 in Wuhan. The average R(0) in Wuhan was 2.7, significantly higher than those in other cities ranging from 1.8 to 2.4. The inflection points in the cities outside Hubei Province were between January 30, 2020 and February 3, 2020, while there had not been an obvious downward trend of R(0) in Wuhan.

We showed that medium-frequency mutations are characterized by high prevalence in specific regions and/or in constant competition with other mutations in several regions.

Methods: A prospective case ascertained study design based on the World Health Organization FFX protocol was undertaken in the UK following the detection of the first case in late January 2020. Household contacts of cases were followed using enhanced surveillance forms to establish whether they developed symptoms of COVID-19, became confirmed cases and their outcomes. Household secondary attack rates and serial intervals were estimated. Individual and household basic reproduction numbers were also estimated. The incubation period was estimated using known point source exposures that resulted in secondary cases. Results: A total of 233 households with two or more people were included with a total of 472 contacts. The overall household SAR was 37% (95% CI 31-43%) with a mean serial interval of 4.67 days, an R0 of 1.85 and a household reproduction number of 2.33. We find lower secondary attack rates in larger households. SARs were highest when the primary case was a child. We estimate a mean incubation period of around 4.5 days. Conclusions: High rates of household transmission of COVID-19 were found in the UK emphasising the need for preventative measures in this setting. Careful monitoring of schools reopening is needed to monitor transmission from children.","title":"Transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in household and community settings in the United Kingdom","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: United Kingdom\\r\\ndate: Late January 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 1.85 and a household reproduction number of 2.33\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: prospective case ascertained study design based on the World Health Organization FFX protocol","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"United Kingdom\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"Late January 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.85 and a household reproduction number of 2.33\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"prospective case ascertained study design based on the World Health Organization FFX protocol\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"UK\\", \\"date\\": \\"Late January 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.85\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"prospective case ascertained study design based on the World Health Organization FFX protocol\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020-08-22 00:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"5grstp0p","cord_uid":"5grstp0p","abstract":"Between March 5th and July 25th, 2020, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BH) was 10,090, corresponding to a cumulative incidence rate of 285.7/100,000 population.

International scientific societies and radiation oncology experts suggested RT omission, whenever possible, in older adult early-stage BC patients. Adjuvant RT might be omitted in a highly selected group of older adult early-stage BC patients with favourable prognostic factors. Hypofractionated regimens should be the standard.

Stress has an important impact on dreams, and stress-induced sleep difficulties may also impact dream recall. The present study evaluated associations between sleep, stress and dream content on dream recall during the pandemic. METHODS: A sample of N=419 US adults completed online surveys about sleep and COVID-19 experiences. Participants were asked if they remember more, fewer or about the same amount of dreams as before the pandemic. They were also asked whether the pandemic was associated with more stress, a more regular schedule, improved sleep, worse sleep, more early insomnia, more middle-of-the-night insomnia, more sleepiness, and more naps. They also completed the Insomnia Severity Index, Fatigue Severity Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Brief Index of Sleep Control, Assessment of Sleep Environment, GAD-7 anxiety scale, and PHQ9 depression scale. Multinomial logistic regressions examined correlates of increased or decreased recall (versus same), adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Those who experienced greater schedule regularity were less likely to report decreased recall (RRR=0.50,p<0.0005), as were those who reported sleep improvement (RRR=0.48,p=0.006). Those whose sleep worsened were more likely to report both increased (RRR=1.64,p=0.003) and decreased (RRR=2.16,p<0.0005) recall. Those suffering maintenance insomnia were more likely to report both increased (RRR=1.70,p=0.001) and decreased (RRR=2.68,p<0.0005) recall, as did those who reported more daytime sleepiness (Increased RRR=1.57,p=0.006; Decreased RRR=1.94,p=0.001). Those whose dream content was more negative were more likely to report both increased (RRR=4.05,p<0.005) and decreased (RRR=3.35,p<0.0005) recall, as did those who reported less negative content (Increased RRR=4.20,p<0.0005; Decreased RRR=5.05,p<0.0005). Similarly, those who reported more positive dream content reported both increased (RRR=17.37,p<0.0005) and decreased (RRR=7.14,p=0.02) recall, as did those who reported less positive content (Increased RRR=4.49,p<0.0005; Decreased RRR=5.59,p<0.0005). Less recall was associated with greater insomnia severity (RRR=1.08,p=0.001), fatigue (RRR=1.04,p=0.001), sleepiness (RRR=1.09,p=0.01), COVID stress (RRR=1.67,p=0.03), anxiety (RRR=1.08,p=0.01), and depression (RRR=1.06,p=0.007), worse sleep environment (RRR=1.06,p=0.005), and less sleep control (RRR=0.56,p=0.001).

METHODS: We compared anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG antibody concentrations and antibody-mediated neutralization of spike-angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor binding in vitro following vaccination of non-hospitalized participants by sero-status and acute virus diagnosis history. Participants were analysed before and after mRNA vaccination (BNT162b2/Pfizer or mRNA-1273/Moderna) in a community-based, home-collected, longitudinal serosurvey in the Chicago area (USA); none reported hospitalization for COVID-19.

Responses were evaluated after one (n = 142) or two (n = 191) doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine. After one dose, median post-vaccine IgG concentration and percent surrogate neutralization were each significantly higher among the COVID-19+ (median 48\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb72 \xc3\u201a\xc2\xb5g/ml, IgG; > 99.9% neutralization) compared to the seropositives (3\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb76 \xc3\u201a\xc2\xb5g /ml IgG; 56.5% neutralization) and seronegatives (2\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb76 \xc3\u201a\xc2\xb5g /ml IgG; 38\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb73% neutralization). The latter two groups reached > 95% neutralization after the second vaccine dose. INTERPRETATION: After one dose of mRNA vaccine, individuals previously diagnosed with COVID-19 responded with high levels of anti-RBD IgG and surrogate neutralization of spike-ACE2 interaction. One dose of mRNA vaccine was not sufficient to generate comparably high responses among most persons previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 without a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis, nor among seronegative persons.

Inspired by different possible values of the time-varying reproduction number for the imported cases and the local cases in China, we divided all transmission events into three subsets: imported (the zeroth generation) infecting 1st-generation locals, 1st-generation locals infecting 2nd-generation locals, and other transmissions among 2+.

We performed an outbreak investigation using advanced genomic and statistical techniques to reconstruct likely transmission chains and assess the role of healthcare workers (HCWs) in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: We investigated a nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in a university-affiliated rehabilitation clinic, involving patients and HCWs, with high coverage of pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS). We estimated the time-varying reproduction number from epidemiological data (Rt) and produced a maximum likelihood phylogeny to assess genetic diversity of the pathogen. We combined genomic and epidemiological data into a Bayesian framework to model directionality of transmission. We performed a Case-control study to investigate risk factors for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 acquisition in patients. FINDINGS: The outbreak spanned from March 14 to April 12, 2020 and involved 37 patients (31 with WGS) and 39 employees (31 with WGS) of whom 37 are HCWs. We estimated a peak R(t) between 2.2 \xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u0153 3.6. The phylogenetic tree showed very limited genetic diversity, with 60/62 (96.7%) isolates forming one large cluster of identical genomes. Despite the resulting uncertainty in reconstructed transmission events, our analyses suggest that HCWs (one of whom was the index Case) played an essential role in cross-transmission, with a significantly larger fraction of infections (p < 2.2e-16) attributable to HCWs (70.7%) than expected given the number of HCWs cases (46.7%). The excess of transmission from HCWs was larger when considering infection of patients (79.0%; 95%CI 78.5% - 79.5%), and especially frail patients (Clinical Frailty Scale >5: 82.3%; 95%CI 81.8% - 83.4%). Furthermore, frail patients were found to be at greater risk for nosocomial COVID-19 than other patients (adjusted OR 6.94; 95%CI 2.13 \xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u0153 22.57). INTERPRETATION: This outbreak report highlights the essential role of HCWs in SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in healthcare settings. Limited genetic diversity in pathogen genomes hampered the reconstruction of individual transmission events, resulting in substantial uncertainty in who infected whom. However, our study shows that despite such uncertainty, significant transmission patterns can be observed.","title":"Explosive nosocomial outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in a rehabilitation clinic: the limits of genomics for outbreak reconstruction","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-08-27 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"x7jfgb8f","cord_uid":"x7jfgb8f","abstract":"AIM: To estimate the epidemiological parameters related to the Covid-19 outbreak in Iran. BACKGROUND: Estimating the epidemiological parameters of new public health threat (COVID-19) is essential to support and inform public health decision-making in different communities including Iran. METHODS: We established a mathematical model to estimate the epidemiological parameters from 19 Feb to 15 March based on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Iran. Then, we estimated the effect of early traffic restriction on our estimation. RESULTS: We estimated the R0 at 2.11 (95% CI, 1.87-2.50) and the infected number at 92,260 (95% CI: 59,263 -152,212) by 15 March. Our estimate for the ascertainment rate was about 1.2% (95% CI: 1.1-1.4). The latent period estimation was 4.24 (95% CI: 2.84-6.65). We observed a decline in our estimate after considering the traffic restriction. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that health authorities in Iran must take impactful strategies to control the COVID-19 outbreak to reach R0<1. Therefore, the establishment of complementary, multilateral, and cost-effective measures for the treatment of symptomatic and early diagnosis and isolation of asymptomatic cases/contacts are strongly recommended because of low ascertainment rate and large number of infected cases. We additionally recommend that traffic restriction be combined with other controlling measures.","title":"Early estimation of the epidemiological parameters of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-2019) outbreak in Iran: 19 Feb-15 March, 2020","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Iran\\r\\ndate: 19 Feb-15 March, 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 2.11\\r\\n%CI values: (95% CI, 1.87-2.50)\\r\\nmethod: mathematical model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Iran\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"19 Feb-15 March, 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.11\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CI, 1.87-2.50)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"mathematical model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Iran\\", \\"date\\": \\"19 Feb to 15 March, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.11\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CI, 1.87-2.55)\\", \\"method\\": \\"mathematical model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"2n7ojlf6","cord_uid":"2n7ojlf6","abstract":"Importance: Taiwan is one of the few countries with initial success in COVID-19 control without strict lockdown or school closure.

Objective: To compare and evaluate the effectiveness of case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and population-based (including social distancing and facial masking) interventions for COVID-19 in Taiwan. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used a stochastic branching process model using COVID-19 epidemic data from Taiwan, an island nation of 23.6 million people, with no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported for 253 days between April and December 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Effective reproduction number of COVID-19 cases (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 primary case) and the probability of outbreak extinction (0 new cases within 20 generations). For model development and calibration, an estimation of the incubation period (interval from exposure to symptom onset), serial interval (time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair), and the statistical distribution of the number of any subsequent infections generated by 1 primary case was calculated. Results: This study analyzed data from 158 confirmed COVID-19 cases (median age, 45 years; interquartile range, 25-55 years; 84 men [53%]). An estimated 55% (95% credible interval [CrI], 41%-68%) of transmission events occurred during the presymptomatic stage. In our estimated analysis, case detection, contact tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts (regardless of symptoms) was estimated to decrease the reproduction number from the counterfactual value of 2.50 to 1.53 (95% CrI, 1.50-1.57), which would not be sufficient for epidemic control, which requires a value of less than 1. In our estimated analysis, voluntary population-based interventions, if used alone, were estimated to have reduced the reproduction number to 1.30 (95% CrI, 1.03-1.58). Combined case-based and population-based interventions were estimated to reduce the reproduction number to below unity (0.85; 95% CrI, 0.78-0.89). Results were similar for additional analyses with influenza data and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness research study, the combination of case-based and population-based interventions (with wide adherence) may explain the success of COVID-19 control in Taiwan in 2020. Either category of interventions alone would have been insufficient, even in a country with an effective public health system and comprehensive contact tracing program.

Rapid, widespread infection of MCI inmates was reported, with nearly 80% of inmates infected within three weeks of first reported inmate case. These data are consistent with (i) a basic reproduction number greater than 14, together with a single initially infected inmate, (ii) an initial super-spreading event resulting in several hundred initially infected inmates, together with a basic reproduction number of approximately three, and (iii) earlier undetected circulation of virus among inmates prior to April. Conclusions and relevance. Mass testing data are consistent with extreme transmissibility, super-spreading events, or undetected circulation of virus among inmates.

One of the most typical interventions is the social distancing such as lockdown that would contribute to reduce the number of contacts among undiagnosed individuals. However, prolongation of the period of such a restrictive intervention could hugely affect the social and economic systems, and the outbreak will come back if the strong social distancing policy will end earlier due to the economic damage. Therefore, the social distancing policy should be followed by massive testing accompanied with quarantine to eradicate the infection. METHODS: In this paper, we construct a mathematical model and discuss the effect of massive testing with quarantine, which would be less likely to affect the social and economic systems, and its efficacy has been proved in South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and Hong Kong. RESULTS: By numerical calculation, we show that the control reproduction number is monotone decreasing and convex downward with respect to the testing rate, which implies that the improvement of the testing rate would highly contribute to reduce the epidemic size if the original testing rate is small. Moreover, we show that the recurrence of the COVID-19 epidemic in Japan could be possible after the lifting of the state of emergency if there is no massive testing and quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: If we have entered into an explosive phase of the epidemic, the massive testing could be a strong tool to prevent the disease as long as the positively reacted individuals will be effectively quarantined, no matter whether the positive reaction is pseudo or not. Since total population could be seen as a superposition of smaller communities, we could understand how testing and quarantine policy might be powerful to control the disease.","title":"Possible effects of mixed prevention strategy for COVID-19 epidemic: massive testing, quarantine and social distancing","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-07-06 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"dks24zau","cord_uid":"dks24zau","abstract":"Greece imposed a nationwide lockdown in March 2020 to mitigate transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the first epidemic wave.

The model simulates three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and changes in death statistics. We consider local and non-local modes of disease transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modelled as a discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the Monte-Carlo method in the simulations. The following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is R0=2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The healthcare system capacity is simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per 100,000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare \'do-nothing\' strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We study epidemics in the pre-vacine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a hybrid strategy where lockdown is held for some time and is then completely released, is inefficient.","title":"Modelling Excess Mortality in Covid-19-Like Epidemics","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"3dcbf1fh","cord_uid":"3dcbf1fh","abstract":"Epidemiology models with constant parameters may not capture the infection patterns in the presence of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical mitigation measures during a pandemic, since infectiousness is a function of time.

Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used an age-structured disease transmission model, parameterized with census data and estimates from published literature, to simulate the estimated synergistic effect of interventions in reducing attack rates during the course of 1 year among a synthetic population representative of the US demographic composition. The population included 6 age groups of 0 to 4, 5 to 10, 11 to 18, 19 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 years or older based on US census data. Data were analyzed from December 12, 2020, to February 26, 2021. Exposures: In addition to the isolation of symptomatic cases within 24 hours of symptom onset, vaccination of adults was implemented to reach a 40% to 60% coverage during 1 year with an efficacy of 95% against symptomatic and severe COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: The combinations of proportion and speed for detecting silent infections among children that would suppress future attack rates to less than 5%. Results: In the base-case scenarios with an effective reproduction number Re = 1.2, a targeted approach that identifies 11% of silent infections among children within 2 days and 14% within 3 days after infection would bring attack rates to less than 5% with 40% vaccination coverage of adults. If silent infections among children remained undetected, achieving the same attack rates would require an unrealistically high vaccination coverage (&#8805;81%) of this age group, in addition to 40% vaccination coverage of adults. The estimated effect of identifying silent infections was robust in sensitivity analyses with respect to vaccine efficacy against infection and reduced susceptibility of children to infection. Conclusions and Relevance: In this simulation modeling study of a synthetic US population, in the absence of vaccine availability for children, a targeted approach to rapidly identify silent COVID-19 infections in this age group was estimated to significantly mitigate disease burden.

Ultimately we provide error corrected estimates for commonly used metrics such as infection fatality ratio and overall case ascertainment for all 55 states and territories considered, along with the United States in aggregate, in order to correlate outbreak severity with first wave intervention attributes and suggest potential management strategies for future outbreaks. We observe a theoretically predicted inverse proportionality relation between outbreak size and lockdown rate, with scale dependent on the underlying reproduction number and simulations suggesting a critical population quarantine \\"half-life\\" of 30 days independent of other model parameters.","title":"Modeling COVID-19 outbreaks in United States with distinct testing, lockdown speed and fatigue rates","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-01-06 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"nlatfc7x","cord_uid":"nlatfc7x","abstract":"BackgroundHealthcare workers (HCWs) and ethnic minority groups are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection and adverse outcome.

This study evaluated the transmissibility of the infectious disease and analyzed its association with temperature and humidity, in order to put forward suggestions on how to suppress the transmission. Methods: In this study, we revised the reported data in Wuhan to estimate the actual number of confirmed cases. Then we used the equation derived from the Susceptible\xe2\u20ac\u201cExposed\xe2\u20ac\u201cInfectious\xe2\u20ac\u201cRecovered (SEIR) model to calculate R0 from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020 in 11 major cities in China for comparison. With the calculation results, we conducted correlation analysis and regression analysis between R0 and temperature and humidity to see the impact of weather on the transmissibility of COVID-19. Results: It was estimated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases had exceeded 45,000 by February 13, 2020 in Wuhan. The average R0 in Wuhan was 2.7011, significantly higher than those in other cities ranging from 1.7762 to 2.3700. The inflection points in the cities outside Hubei Province were between January 30, 2020 and February 3, 2020, while there had not been an obvious downward trend of R0 in Wuhan. R0 negatively correlated with both temperature and humidity, which was significant at the 0.01 level. Conclusions: The transmissibility of COVID-19 was strong and importance should be attached to the intervention of its transmission especially in Wuhan. According to the correlation between R0 and weather, the spread of disease will be suppressed as the weather warms.","title":"Transmissibility of COVID-19 and its association with temperature and humidity","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: new coronavirus disease COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Wuhan\\r\\ndate: from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 2.7011\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Susceptible\xe2\u20ac\u201cExposed\xe2\u20ac\u201cInfectious\xe2\u20ac\u201cRecovered (SEIR) model\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: new coronavirus disease COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: other cities,china\\r\\ndate: from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020\\r\\nR0 value: ranging from 1.7762 to 2.3700\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Susceptible\xe2\u20ac\u201cExposed\xe2\u20ac\u201cInfectious\xe2\u20ac\u201cRecovered (SEIR) model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"new coronavirus disease COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Wuhan\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.7011\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Susceptible\xe2\u20ac\u201cExposed\xe2\u20ac\u201cInfectious\xe2\u20ac\u201cRecovered (SEIR) model\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"new coronavirus disease COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"other cities,china\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"from January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"ranging from 1.7762 to 2.3700\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Susceptible\xe2\u20ac\u201cExposed\xe2\u20ac\u201cInfectious\xe2\u20ac\u201cRecovered (SEIR) model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"new coronavirus disease COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Wuhan, Hubei Province, China\\", \\"date\\": \\"January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.701\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"(SEIR) model\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"new coronavirus disease COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"other cities\\", \\"date\\": \\"January 24, 2020 to February 13, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.7762 to 2.3700\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"(SEIR) model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020","action":"change_main_cord_id","cluster_id":"1413"},{"main_cord_uid":"4zwn2bus","cord_uid":"4zwn2bus","abstract":"The rapidly spreading Covid-19 that affected almost all countries, was first reported at the end of 2019.

Since the earliest stages of this major pandemic, academics have done a huge amount of research in order to understand the disease, develop medication, vaccines and tests, and model its spread. Among these studies, a great deal of effort has been invested in the estimation of epidemic parameters in the early stage, for the countries affected by Covid-19, hence to predict the course of the epidemic but the variability of the controls over the course of the epidemic complicated the modeling processes. In this article, the determination of the basic reproduction number, the mean duration of the infectious period, the estimation of the timing of the peak of the epidemic wave is discussed using early phase data. Daily case reports and daily fatalities for ten countries over the period January 22, 2020 - April 18, 2020 are evaluated using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. For each country, the SIR models fitting cumulative infective case data within 5% error are analysed. It is observed that the basic reproduction number and the mean duration of the infectious period can be estimated only in cases where the spread of the epidemic is over (for China and South Korea in the present case). Nevertheless, it is shown that the timing of the maximum and timings of the inflection points of the proportion of infected individuals can be robustly estimated from the normalized data. The validation of the estimates by comparing the predictions with actual data has shown that the predictions were realised for all countries except USA, as long as lock-down measures were retained.","title":"What Can We Estimate from Fatality and Infectious Case Data using the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model?

Understanding this is crucial to predict pathogen spread and the effectiveness of control efforts. Most analyses of contact patterns to date have focused on high-income settings. METHODS: Here, we conduct a systematic review and individual-participant meta-analysis of surveys carried out in low- and middle-income countries and compare patterns of contact in these settings to surveys previously carried out in high-income countries. Using individual-level data from 28,503 participants and 413,069 contacts across 27 surveys, we explored how contact characteristics (number, location, duration, and whether physical) vary across income settings. RESULTS: Contact rates declined with age in high- and upper-middle-income settings, but not in low-income settings, where adults aged 65+ made similar numbers of contacts as younger individuals and mixed with all age groups. Across all settings, increasing household size was a key determinant of contact frequency and characteristics, with low-income settings characterised by the largest, most intergenerational households. A higher proportion of contacts were made at home in low-income settings, and work/school contacts were more frequent in high-income strata. We also observed contrasting effects of gender across income strata on the frequency, duration, and type of contacts individuals made. CONCLUSIONS: These differences in contact patterns between settings have material consequences for both spread of respiratory pathogens and the effectiveness of different non-pharmaceutical interventions.

In contrast, with control measures, which reduce the contact rate to about 25% of its initial value, the expected final number of cases is reduced to 1778 in Hong Kong and 226 in Toronto (Canada).

First, we consider a metapopulation model of infection spread where transmission hot zones are explicitly described by independent demes in which the same people repeatedly interact (referred to as \\"static\\" hot zones, e.g. nursing homes, food processing plants, prisons, etc.). These are assumed to exists in addition to a \\"community at large\\" compartment in which virus transmission is less effective. This model yields a number of predictions that are relevant to interpreting epidemiological patterns in COVID19 data. Even if the rate of community virus spread is assumed to be relatively slow, outbreaks in hot zones can temporarily accelerate initial community virus growth, which can lead to an overestimation of the viral reproduction number in the general population. Further, the model suggests that hot zones are a reservoir enabling the prolonged persistence of the virus at \\"infection plateaus\\" following implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, which has been frequently observed in data. The second model considers \\"dynamic\\" hot zones, which can repeatedly form by drawing random individuals from the community, and subsequently dissolve (e.g. restaurants, bars, movie theaters). While dynamic hot zones can accelerate the average rate of community virus spread and can provide opportunities for targeted interventions, they do not predict the occurrence of infection plateaus or other atypical epidemiological dynamics. The models therefore identify two types of transmission hot zones with very different effects on the infection dynamics, which warrants further epidemiological investigations.","title":"Effect of hot zone infection outbreaks on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the community at large","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-11-24 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"n7gxgfhi","cord_uid":"n7gxgfhi","abstract":"The death toll for Covid-19 may be reduced by dividing the population into two classes, the vulnerable and the fit, with different lockdown regimes.

Yet, due to the exponential nature of epidemic growth, the error due to this simplification can be rapidly amplified and lead to inaccurate predictions and/or risk evaluation.

We found the R 0 to be 1.84 [95% CI: 1.82\xe2\u20ac\u201c1.86], 1.82 [95% CI: 1.81\xe2\u20ac\u201c1.84], and 1.94 [95% CI: 1.92\xe2\u20ac\u201c1.96], for MERS, COVID-19, and SARS SI respectively without adjusting reporting rate. With the adjusted reporting rate, R 0 reduced to 1.63 [95% CI: 1.62\xe2\u20ac\u201c1.65], 1.62 [95% CI: 1.61\xe2\u20ac\u201c1.64], and 1.71 [95% CI: 1.70\xe2\u20ac\u201c1.73] for a five-fold increase. Inverse association between the reporting rate and the basic reproduction number was observed.ConclusionThe R 0 was found to be 1.87 for existing cases and was reduced to 1.65 for the five-fold increase of the early reporting rate. Findings suggest a continued COVID-19 outbreak in Bangladesh and immediate steps need to be taken to control.","title":"Estimation of the basic reproduction number of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Bangladesh: A 65-day outbreak data-driven analysis","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\\r\\nlocation: Bangladesh\\r\\ndate: March 8 to May 11, 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 1.82\\r\\n%CI values: 95% CI: 1.81-1.84\\r\\nmethod: exponential growth model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Bangladesh\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"March 8 to May 11, 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.82\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"95% CI: 1.81-1.84\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"exponential growth model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Bangladesh\\", \\"date\\": \\"March 8 to May 11, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.84\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"[95% CI: 1.82-1.86], [95% CI: 1.81-1.84\\", (with the adjusted reporting rate)\\", \\"method\\": \\"estimated intrinsic growth rate (?3)\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Bangladesh\\", \\"date\\": \\"March 8 to May 11, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.63\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"[95% CI: 1.62-1.65\\", (with the adjusted reporting rate)\\", \\"method\\": \\"estimated intrinsic growth rate (?3)\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Bangladesh\\", \\"date\\": \\"March 8 to May 11, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.62\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"[95% CI: 1.61-1.64\\", \\"method\\": \\"estimated intrinsic growth rate (?3)\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Bangladesh\\", \\"date\\": \\"March 8 to May 11, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.71\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"[95% CI: 1.70-1.73]\\", \\"method\\": \\"estimated intrinsic growth rate (?3)\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"foxbu4ec","cord_uid":"foxbu4ec","abstract":"Policy makers around the world are facing unprecedented challenges in making decisions on when and what degrees of measures should be implemented to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: We estimated the risk for prevalent hypertension with incident respiratory diseases over mean follow-up of 8 years among 377,143 British participants in the UK Biobank. Mendelian randomization of blood pressure on pneumonia was implemented using 75 independent, genome-wide significant variants associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressures among 299,024 individuals not in the UK Biobank. Secondary analyses with pulmonary function tests were performed. Findings: In total, 107,310 participants (30%) had hypertension at UK Biobank enrollment, and 9,969 (3%) developed pneumonia during follow-up. Prevalent hypertension was independently associated with increased risk for incident pneumonia (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.29-1.43; p < 0.001), as well as other incident respiratory diseases. Genetic predisposition to a 5 mm Hg increase in blood pressure was associated with increased risk for incident pneumonia for systolic blood pressure (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.04-1.13; p < 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 1.03-1.20; p = 0.005). Additionally, consistent with epidemiologic associations, increased blood pressure genetic risk was significantly associated with reduced performance on pulmonary function tests (p < 0.001). Conclusions: These results suggest that elevated blood pressure increases risk for pneumonia. Maintaining adequate blood pressure control, in addition to other measures, may reduce risk for pneumonia. Funding: S.M.Z. (1F30HL149180-01), M.H. (T32HL094301-07), and P.N.

Our objective in this study is to evaluate the epidemiological features of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and death in Fars province, Iran. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from February 18th to September 30th, 2020, where age, history of underlying diseases, sex, community-wide quarantine, nationality, close contact, pregnancy, medical staff job, traveling, and residency were compared between alive and deceased groups. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS software, version 22.0, and the significance level was set at 0.05. Results: Regarding 57958 new cases of COVID-19, the basic reproduction number (R0) was estimated as 2.8, requiring a minimum of 65% immunization to reach herd immunity. Moreover, an R0=0.36 was required to reach the endemic state in the region. The incidence, mortality, fatality, and recurrence rates of COVID-19 were estimated as 1347.9 per 100,000 dwellers, 209.5 per 1000,000 dwellers, 1.6 %, and 3.1 per 100,000 dwellers, respectively. Age, history of underlying diseases, urban residency, and the male sex were significantly higher in the deceased group (OR=1.09, 5.48, 1.24, and 1.32;All Ps<0.001, <0.001, 0.005, and <0.001, respectively).

We hypothesize that in The Netherlands the same environmental factors and mobility trends that are associated with the seasonality of flu-like illnesses are predictors of COVID-19 seasonality as well. METHODS: We used meteorological, pollen/hay fever and mobility data from the Netherlands. For the reproduction number of COVID-19 (R(t)), we used daily estimates from the Dutch State Institute for Public Health. For all datasets, we selected the overlapping period of COVID-19 and the first allergy season: from February 17, 2020 till September 21, 2020 (n = 218). Backward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop an environmental prediction model of the R(t) of COVID-19. Next, we studied whether adding mobility trends to an environmental model improved the predictive power. RESULTS: Through stepwise backward multiple linear regression four highly significant (p < 0.01) predictive factors are selected in our combined model: temperature, solar radiation, hay fever incidence, and mobility to indoor recreation locations. Our combined model explains 87.5% of the variance of R(t) of COVID-19 and has a good and highly significant fit: F(4, 213) = 374.2, p < 0.00001. This model had a better overall predictive performance than a solely environmental model, which explains 77.3% of the variance of R(t) (F(4, 213) = 181.3, p < 0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the combined mobility and environmental model can adequately predict the seasonality of COVID-19 in a country with a temperate climate like the Netherlands. In this model higher solar radiation, higher temperature and hay fever are related to lower COVID-19 reproduction, and higher mobility to indoor recreation locations is related to an increased COVID-19 spread.","title":"Environmental factors and mobility predict COVID-19 seasonality in the Netherlands","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2022-03-04 05:00:00","action":"keep","cluster_id":"154"},{"main_cord_uid":"l9x8c2dq","cord_uid":"l9x8c2dq","abstract":"To counter the second COVID-19 wave, the Italian government has adopted a scheme of three sets of restrictions (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis.

It is used to guide officials in their response to an epidemic. This research demonstrates an effective and simple approach that estimates the parameters of any variations of the SEIR model. This new technique will be demonstrated on the spread of COVID-19 in Libya. Methods: A five compartmental epidemic model is used to model the COVID-19 pandemic in Libya. Two sets of data are needed to evaluate the model parameters, the cumulative number of symptomatic cases and the total number of active cases. This data along with the assumption that the cumulative number of symptomatic cases grows exponentially, to determine most of the model parameters. Results: Libya epidemic start-date was estimated as t_o=-18.5 days, corresponding to May 5th. We mathematically demonstrated that the number of active cases follows two competing exponential distributions: a positive exponential function, measuring how many new cases are added, and a negative exponential function, measuring how many cases recovered. From this distribution we showed that the average recovery time is 48 days, and the incubation period is 15.2 days. Finally, the productive number was estimated as R0 = 7.6. Conclusions: With only the cumulative number of cases and the total number of active cases of COVID19, several important SEIR model parameters can be measured effectively.

Since testing was not widespread early in the pandemic in the U.S., I do not use data on confirmed cases and rely solely on public fatality data to estimate model parameters. Fits to the first 20 days of data determine a degenerate combination of the basic reproduction number, R0, and the mean time to removal from the infectious population, 1/{gamma} with {gamma}(R0 - 1) = 0.25(0.21) inverse days for NYC (Cook County). Equivalently, the initial doubling time was td = 2.8(3.4) days for NYC (Cook). The early fatality data suggest that both locations had infections in early February. I model the mitigation measures implemented in mid-March in both locations (distancing, quarantine, isolation, etc) via a time-dependent reproduction number Rt that declines monotonically from R0 to a smaller asymptotic value, with a parameterized functional form. The timing (mid-March) and duration (several days) of the transitions in Rt appear well determined by the data. However, the fatality data determine only a degenerate combination of the parameters R0, the percentage reduction in social contact due to mitigation measures, X, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), f . With flat priors, based on simulations the NYC model parameters have 95.45% credible intervals of R0 = 3.0 - 5.4, X = 80 - 99.9% and f = 2 - 6%, with 5 - 13% of the population asymptotically infected. A strong external prior indicating a lower value of f or of 1/{gamma} would imply lower values of R0 and X and higher percentage infection of the population. For Cook County, the evolution was qualitatively different: after mitigation measures were implemented, the daily fatality counts reached a plateau for about a month before tailing off. This is consistent with an SIR model that exhibits \\"critical slowing-down\\", in which Rt plateaus at a value just above unity. For Cook County, the 95.45% credible intervals for the model parameters are much broader and shifted downward, R0 = 1.4 - 4.7, X = 26 - 54%, and f = 0.1 - 0.6% with 15 - 88% of the population asymptotically infected. Despite the apparently lower efficacy of its social contact reduction measures, Cook County has had significantly fewer fatalities per population than NYC, D{infty}/N = 100 vs. 270 per 100,000. In the model, this is attributed to the lower inferred IFR for Cook; an external prior pointing to similar values of the IFR for the two locations would instead chalk up the difference in D/N to differences in the relative growth rate of the disease. I derive a model-dependent threshold, Xcrit, for \\"safe\\" re-opening, that is, for easing of contact reduction that would not trigger a second wave; for NYC, the models predict that increasing social contact by more than 20% from post-mitigation levels will lead to renewed spread, while for Cook County the threshold value is very uncertain, given the parameter degeneracies. The timing of 2nd-wave growth will depend on the amplitude of contact increase relative to Xcrit and on the asymptotic growth rate, and the impact in terms of fatalities will depend on the parameter f .","title":"A \\"Tail\\" of Two Cities: Fatality-based Modeling of COVID-19 Evolution in New York City and Cook County, IL","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-08-12 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"ho27d3ob","cord_uid":"ho27d3ob","abstract":"BackgroundThe outbreak of Coronavirus disease, which originated in Wuhan, China in 2019, has affected the lives of billions of people globally.

MethodsIn this work, we deduce and analyze both initial and effective reproduction numbers for 12 diverse world regions between February and December of 2020.

ResultsWe quantify in each region the following reductions in the observed effective reproduction numbers of the pandemic: i) reduction due to decrease in mobility (as captured in Google mobility reports); ii) reduction due to mask wearing and mask compliance; iii) reduction due to other NPIs, over and above the ones identified in i) and ii). ConclusionIn most cases mobility reduction coming from nationwide lockdown measures has helped stave off the initial wave in countries who took these types of measures. Beyond the first waves, mask mandates and compliance, together with social-distancing measures (which we refer to as other NPIs) have allowed some control of subsequent disease spread.

Through modeling, we can estimate the half-life of infected cells, the exponential growth rate, and the basic reproduction number (R(0)). To calculate R(0) from virus load data, the death rate of productively infected cells is required. This can be readily estimated from treatment data collected during the chronic phase, but is difficult to determine from acute infection data. Here, we propose two new models that can reliably estimate the average life span of infected cells from acute-phase data, and apply both methods to experimental data from humanized mice infected with HIV-1. METHODS: Both new models, called as the reduced quasi-steady state (RQS) model and the piece-wise regression (PWR) model, are derived by simplification of a standard model for the acute-phase dynamics of target cells, viruses and infected cells. By having only a limited number of parameters, both models allow us to reliably estimate the death rate of productively infected cells. Simulated datasets with plausible parameter values are generated with the standard model to compare the performance of the new models with that of the major previous model (i.e., the simple exponential model). Finally, we fit models to time course data from HIV-1 infected humanized mice to estimate the several important parameters characterizing their acute infection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The new models provided much better estimates than the previous model because they more precisely capture the de novo infection process. Both models describe the acute phase of HIV-1 infected humanized mice reasonably well, and we estimated an average death rate of infected cells of 0.61 and 0.61, an average exponential growth rate of 0.69 and 0.76, and an average basic reproduction number of 2.30 and 2.38 in the RQS model and the PWR model, respectively. These estimates are fairly close to those obtained in humans.","title":"Improving the estimation of the death rate of infected cells from time course data during the acute phase of virus infections: application to acute HIV-1 infection in a humanized mouse model","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: HIV-1\\r\\nlocation: -\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 2.30\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Reduced quasi-steady state (RQS) model\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: HIV-1\\r\\nlocation: -\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 2.38\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: the piece-wise regression (PWR) model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"HIV-1\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.30\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Reduced quasi-steady state (RQS) model\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"HIV-1\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.38\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"the piece-wise regression (PWR) model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"HIV-1\\", \\"location\\": \\"-\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.30\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"reduce quasi-steady state (RQS) model and the piece-wise regression (PWR) model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2014-05-21 10:00:00","cluster_id":"1234"},{"main_cord_uid":"vc29aif3","cord_uid":"vc29aif3","abstract":"Mass media reports can induce individual behaviour change during a disease outbreak, which has been found to be useful as it reduces the force of infection.

Parametric models such as the commonly used susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) compartment models fitted to observed incidence time series have limitations due to the time-dependency of the parameters. Furthermore, fatalities are delayed with respect to the counts of new cases, and the reproduction cycle leads to periodic patterns in incidence time series. Therefore, based on comprehensible nonparametric methods including time-delay correlation analyses, estimates of crucial parameters that characterise the COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on the German epidemic are presented using publicly available time-series data on prevalence and fatalities. The estimates for Germany are compared with the results for seven other countries (France, Italy, the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Spain, Switzerland, and Brazil). The duration from diagnosis to death resulting from delay-time correlations turns out to be 13 days with high accuracy for Germany and Switzerland. For the other countries, the time-to-death durations have wider confidence intervals. With respect to the German data, the two time series of new cases and fatalities exhibit a strong coherence. Based on the time lag between diagnoses and deaths, properly delayed asymptotic as well as instantaneous fatality\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u0153case ratios are calculated. The temporal median of the instantaneous fatality\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u0153case ratio with time lag of 13 days between cases and deaths for Germany turns out to be 0.02. Time courses of asymptotic fatality\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u0153case ratios are presented for other countries, which substantially differ during the first half of the pandemic but converge to a narrow range with standard deviation 0.0057 and mean 0.024. Similar results are obtained from comparing time courses of instantaneous fatality\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u20ac\u0153case ratios with optimal delay for the 8 exemplarily chosen countries. The basic reproduction number, R0, for Germany is estimated to be between 2.4 and 3.4 depending on the generation time, which is estimated based on a delay autocorrelation analysis. Resonances at about 4 days and 7 days are observed, partially attributable to weekly periodicity of sampling. The instantaneous (time-dependent) reproduction number is estimated from the incident (counts of new) cases, thus allowing us to infer the temporal behaviour of the reproduction number during the epidemic course. The time course of the reproduction number turns out to be consistent with the time-dependent per capita growth.","title":"Exploring COVID-19 daily records of diagnosed cases and fatalities based on simple nonparametric methods","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Germany\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 2.4 and 3.4\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: comprehensible nonparametric methods including time-delay correlation analyses","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Germany\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.4 and 3.4\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"comprehensible nonparametric methods including time-delay correlation analyses\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Germany\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"between 2.4 and 3.4\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"comprehensible nonparametric methods including time-delay correlation analyses\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"ecen7ke8","cord_uid":"ecen7ke8","abstract":"Objective: To understand the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in different epidemic stages in Gansu province. Methods: Epidemiological investigation was conducted to collect the information of confirmed COVID-19 cases, including demographic, epidemiological and clinical information. Results: As of 25 February 2020, a total of 91 confirmed COVID-19 cases had been reported in Gansu. The epidemic of COVID-19 in Gansu can be divided as three different stages, i.e. imported case stage, imported-case plus indigenous case stage, and indigenous case stage. A total of 63 cases were clustered cases (69.23%), 3 cases were medical staff infected with non-occupational exposure. The initial symptoms included fever (54.95%, 50/91), cough (52.75%, 48/91), or fatigue (28.57%, 26/91), the proportion of each symptom showed a decreasing trend along with the three epidemic stages, but only the differences in proportions of fever (trend &#967;2=2.20, P<0.05) and fatigue (trend &#967;2=3.18, P<0.05) among the three epidemic stages were statistically significant. The cases with critical severe symptoms accounted for 42.85% (6/14), 23.73% (14/59) and 16.67% (3/18), respectively, in three epidemic stages, showed a decreasing trend (H=6.45, P<0.05). Also, the incubation period prolonged along with the epidemic stage (F=51.65, P<0.01), but the intervals between disease onset and hospital visit (F=5.32, P<0.01), disease onset and diagnosis (F=5.25, P<0.01) became shorter along with the epidemic stage. Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) had decreased from 2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu was caused by the imported cases, and about 2/3 cases were clustered ones. No medical worker was observed to be infected by occupational exposure. With the progression of COVID-19 epidemic in Gansu, the change in initial symptom and incubation period suggests, the early screening cannot only depend on body temperature monitoring.","title":"[Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in Gansu province]","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Gansu province\\r\\ndate: As of 25 February 2020\\r\\nR0 value: decreased from 2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Epidemiological investigation","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Gansu province\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"As of 25 February 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"decreased from 2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Epidemiological investigation\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Gansu\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.61 in imported case stage to 0.66 in indigenous case stage\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"Epidemiological investigation\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"crhs4ygw","cord_uid":"crhs4ygw","abstract":"BACKGROUND SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantities, measured by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), have been proposed to stratify clinical risk or determine analytical performance targets.

METHODS Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RNA distributions (Cq and copies/mL) from more than 6000 patients from three clinical laboratories in UK, Belgium and the Republic of Korea were analyzed. Impact of Cq cut-offs on clinical sensitivity was assessed. The June/July 2020 INSTAND EQA scheme SARS-CoV-2 materials were used to estimate laboratory reported copies/mL and to estimate the variation in copies/mL for a given Cq. RESULTS When the WHO suggested Cq cut-off of 25 was applied, the clinical sensitivity dropped to as little as about 16%. Clinical sensitivity also dropped to as little as about 27% when a simulated LOD of 106 copies/mL was applied. The inter-laboratory variation for a given Cq value was >1000 fold in copies/mL (99% CI). CONCLUSION While RT-qPCR has been instrumental in the response to COVID-19, we recommend Cq (Ct or Cp) values not be used to set clinical cut-offs, or diagnostic performance targets, due to poor inter-laboratory reproducibility; calibrated copy-based units (used elsewhere in virology) offer more reproducible alternatives.

We begin by analyzing the vector model dynamics and by determining the offspring reproductive number denoted by N as well as the trivial and nontrivial equilibria. Using theory of cooperative systems and the general theory of Lyapunov, we prove that, although there is a possibility that the trivial equilibrium coexists with a positive equilibrium, it remains globally asymptotically stable whenever N\xe2\u2030\xa41. The fact that the non-trivial equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable permits us to reduce the study of the full model to the study of a reduced model whenever N&gt;1. Thus, we analyze the reduced model by computing the basic reproduction number R0, equilibrium points as well as asymptotic stability of each equilibrium point. We also explore the nature of the bifurcation for the disease-free equilibrium from R0=1. By the application of the centre manifold theory, we prove that the backward bifurcation phenomenon can occur in our model, which means that the necessary condition R0&lt;1 is not sufficient to guarantee the final extinction of the disease in human populations. To calibrate our model, we estimate model parameters on clinical data from the last Chikungunya epidemic which occurred in Chad, using the non-linear least-square method. We find out that R0=1.8519, which means that we are in an endemic state since R0&gt;1. To determine model parameters that are responsible for disease spread in the human community, we perform sensitivity analysis (SA) using a global method. It follows that the density-dependent death rate of mosquitoes and the average number of mosquito bites are key parameters in the disease dynamics. Following this, we thus formulate an optimal control model by including in the autonomous model, four time-dependent control functions to fight the disease spread. Pontryagin\xe2\u20ac\u2122s maximum principle is used to characterize our optimal controls. Numerical simulations, using parameter values of Chikungunya transmission dynamics, and efficiency analysis, are conducted to determine the better control strategy which guaranteed the final extinction of the disease in human populations.","title":"Mathematical modeling and projections of a vector-borne disease with optimal control strategies: A case study of the Chikungunya in Chad","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: Chikungunya\\r\\nlocation: Chad\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: 1.8519\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: non-linear least-square method","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"Chikungunya\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Chad\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.8519\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"non-linear least-square method\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"Chinkungunya\\", \\"location\\": \\"Chad\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.8511\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"Non-linear least-square method\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"58qmh46w","cord_uid":"58qmh46w","abstract":"Objective: To analyze of the transmission characteristics of a cluster of COVID-19 cases in Chongqing and evaluate the infectivity of COVID-19 in the incubation period.

Methods and findings This retrospective observational case series study analyzed transmission patterns of real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections found by local health authorities and commercial laboratories during January 14 through July 31, 2020 in Japan. After ascertaining the infection source for every symptomatic case as clusters at households, daycare facilities, schools, hospitals and workplaces etc., their associated transmission patterns were analyzed. Identified cases were divided into three groups: underage, < 20; adults, 20- 59; and elderly people 60 years old and older. The reproductive number (R)s of respective transmission directions found for the respective age groups were compared. Of 26,986 total cases, 23,746 unknown cases were found, leaving 3,240 ascertained sources of infection (12.0%) comprising 125 (3.9%) underage, 2350 (72.5%) adult, and 765 (23.6%) elderly people. The respective Rs of underage infection sources directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0415 (95% CI, 0.0138- 0.0691), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.9171-1.3226), and 0.2811 (95% CI, 0.2074-0.3687). The respective Rs of adult infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0140 (95% CI, 0.0120-0.0162), 0.5392 (95% CI, 0.5236-0.5550), and 0.1135 (95% CI, 0.1074-0.1197). The respective Rs of elderly infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated as 0.065 (95% CI, 0.0039-0.0091), 0.3264 (95% CI, 0.3059-0.3474), and 0.3991 (95% CI, 0.3757-0.4229). Conclusions The main sources of SARS-CoV-2 infection were adults and elderly people. The R of underage people directed to adults was greater than 1 because of close familial contact but they were unlikely to become carriers transmitting SARS-CoV-2 because they accounted for a minority for transmissions. Apparently, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among adults and elderly people, suggesting that infection control of SARS-CoV-2 should be managed specifically by generation.","title":"SARS-CoV-2 infection control implementation based on sources of infection showing directions for three age groups in Japan","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: SARS-CoV-2\\r\\nlocation: Japan\\r\\ndate: during January 14 through July 31, 2020\\r\\nR0 value: underage infection sources directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0415 (95% CI, 0.0138- 0.0691), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.9171-1.3226), and 0.2811 (95% CI, 0.2074-0.3687)\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: -\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: SARS-CoV-2\\r\\nlocation: Japan\\r\\ndate: during January 14 through July 31, 2020\\r\\nR0 value: adult infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0140 (95% CI, 0.0120-0.0162), 0.5392 (95% CI, 0.5236-0.5550), and 0.1135 (95% CI, 0.1074-0.1197)\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: -\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: SARS-CoV-2\\r\\nlocation: Japan\\r\\ndate: during January 14 through July 31, 2020\\r\\nR0 value: elderly infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated as 0.065 (95% CI, 0.0039-0.0091), 0.3264 (95% CI, 0.3059-0.3474), and 0.3991 (95% CI, 0.3757-0.4229)\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: -","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"SARS-CoV-2\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Japan\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"during January 14 through July 31, 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"underage infection sources directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0415 (95% CI, 0.0138- 0.0691), 1.11 (95% CI, 0.9171-1.3226), and 0.2811 (95% CI, 0.2074-0.3687)\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"-\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"SARS-CoV-2\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Japan\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"during January 14 through July 31, 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"adult infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated respectively as 0.0140 (95% CI, 0.0120-0.0162), 0.5392 (95% CI, 0.5236-0.5550), and 0.1135 (95% CI, 0.1074-0.1197)\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"-\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"SARS-CoV-2\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Japan\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"during January 14 through July 31, 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"elderly infection source directed to underage, adult, and elderly people were estimated as 0.065 (95% CI, 0.0039-0.0091), 0.3264 (95% CI, 0.3059-0.3474), and 0.3991 (95% CI, 0.3757-0.4229)\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"-\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"location\\": \\"Japan\\", \\"date\\": \\"January 14 through July 31, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"0.4415\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CI, 0.0138- 0.0691)\\", \\"method\\": \\"-\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"location\\": \\"Japan\\", \\"date\\": \\"January 14 through July 31, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.11\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CI, 0.9171-1.326)\\", \\"method\\": \\"-\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"location\\": \\"Japan\\", \\"date\\": \\"January 14 through July 31, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"0.492\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CI, 0.5236-0.5550)\\", \\"method\\": \\"-\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"location\\": \\"Japan\\", \\"date\\": \\"January 14 through July 31, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"0.3264\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CI, 0.3059-0.3474)\\", \\"method\\": \\"-\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"SARS-CoV-2\\", \\"location\\": \\"Japan\\", \\"date\\": \\"January 14 through July 31, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"0.4391\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CI, 0.3757-0.4229)\\", \\"method\\": \\"-\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2021-01-15 00:00:00","cluster_id":"1500"},{"main_cord_uid":"5deyoiq8","cord_uid":"5deyoiq8","abstract":"Finding medications or vaccines that may decrease the infectious period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) could potentially reduce transmission in the broader population.

Objective: Conduct a scoping review of the available literature providing estimates of R0 for SARS-CoV-2, provide an overview of the drivers of variation in R0 estimates and the considerations taken in the calculation of the parameter. Design: Scoping review of available literature between the 01 December 2019 and 07 May 2020. Data sources: Both peer-reviewed and pre-print articles were searched for on PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv. Selection criteria: Studies were selected for review if (i) the estimation of R0 represented either the initial stages of the outbreak or the initial stages of the outbreak prior to the onset of widespread population restriction (lockdown), (ii) the exact dates of the study period were provided and (iii) the study provided primary estimates of R0. Results: A total of 20 R0 estimates were extracted from 15 studies. There was substantial variation in the estimates reported. Estimates derived from mathematical models fell within a wider range of 1.94-6.94 than statistical models which fell between the range of 2.2 to 4.4. Several studies made assumptions about the length of the infectious period which ranged from 5.8-20 days and the serial interval which ranged from 4.41-14 days. For a given set of parameters a longer duration of infectiousness or a longer serial interval equates to a higher R0. Several studies took measures to minimise bias in early case reporting, to account for the potential occurrence of super-spreading events, and to account for early sub-exponential epidemic growth. Conclusions: The variation in reported estimates of R0 reflects the complex nature of the parameter itself, including the context (i.e. social/spatial structure), the methodology used to estimate the parameter, and model assumptions. R0 is a fundamental parameter in the study of infectious disease dynamics however it provides limited practical applicability outside of the context in which it was estimated, and should be calculated and interpreted with this in mind.","title":"The basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2: a scoping review of available evidence","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-07-30 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"u5o6fq24","cord_uid":"u5o6fq24","abstract":"Emerging and re-emerging infections such as SARS (2003) and pandemic H1N1 (2009) have caused concern for public health researchers and policy makers due to the increased burden of these diseases on health care systems.

A particularly important quantity in infectious disease epidemiology is the basic reproduction number, R(0.) Estimation of this quantity is crucial for effective control responses in the early phase of an epidemic. In our previous study, an approach for estimating the basic reproduction number in real time was developed. This approach uses case notification data and the structure of potential transmission contacts to accurately estimate R(0) from the limited amount of information available at the early stage of an outbreak. Based on this approach, we extend the existing methodology; the most recent method features intra- and inter-age groups contact heterogeneity. Given the number of newly reported cases at the early stage of the outbreak, with parsimony assumptions on removal distribution and infectivity profile of the diseases, experiments to estimate real time R(0) under different levels of intra- and inter-group contact heterogeneity using two age groups are presented. We show that the new method converges more quickly to the actual value of R(0) than the previous one, in particular when there is high-level intra-group and inter-group contact heterogeneity. With the age specific contact patterns, number of newly reported cases, removal distribution, and information about the natural history of the 2009 pandemic influenza in Hong Kong, we also use the extended model to estimate R(0) and age-specific R(0).","title":"Early real-time estimation of the basic reproduction number of emerging or reemerging infectious diseases in a community with heterogeneous contact pattern: Using data from Hong Kong 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza as an illustrative example","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2015-09-15 00:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"pytbdsq1","cord_uid":"pytbdsq1","abstract":"Background: The spread of the novel coronavirus seems mysterious enough to make us double-check the indices being used to predict its transmission.

The Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model is one of the compartmental dynamic models which can be used to simulate what happens when someone in the community catches a disease, like Covid-19. The classical SIR model assumes that the properties of individuals can be divided into three distinct compartments: S(t) is the total of susceptible persons, I(t) is the total of infected persons and R(t) is the total of recovered person from infection and are now immune against the disease. The model also includes the dedicated effort of the government, the decision makers, and the stakeholders. Theoretically, interventions such as social distancing, mass testing, and isolation of positive cases should slow the rate of the infection spreads. The analysis of equilibrium indicates that the model has two equilibriums. One of them isthe disease free equilibrium and the other one is the endemic equilibrium. If the effort level less than minimum level, than the spread of the virus becomes endemic and if the effort level more than minimum level, than the spread of the virus can be controlled. The basic reproduction number 91D, is used to be an indicator of the expected number of individuals directly infected by an infectious person in a population where all individuals are susceptible to infection. If 910 &lt; 1, then the disease free equilibrium point is stable, meaning that the virus spread can be controlled. If 9t0 &gt; 1, then the disease free equilibrium point is unstable, meaning that the virus spread will continue.

We can estimate when sustained disease transmission will end in a population by calculating the population-specific basic reproduction number [R]0, the expected number of secondary cases generated by an infected person in the absence of any interventions. The value of [R]0 relates to a herd immunity threshold (HIT), which is given by 1 - 1/[R]0. When the immune fraction of a population exceeds this threshold, sustained disease transmission becomes exponentially unlikely (barring mutations allowing SARS-CoV-2 to escape immunity). Here, we report state-level [R]0 estimates obtained using Bayesian inference. Maximum a posteriori estimates range from 7.1 for New Jersey to 2.3 for Wyoming, indicating that disease transmission varies considerably across states and that reaching herd immunity will be more difficult in some states than others. [R]0 estimates were obtained from compartmental models via the next-generation matrix approach after each model was parameterized using regional daily confirmed case reports of COVID-19 from 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020. Our [R]0 estimates characterize infectiousness of ancestral strains, but they can be used to determine HITs for a distinct, currently dominant circulating strain, such as SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta (lineage B.1.617.2), if the relative infectiousness of the strain can be ascertained. On the basis of Delta-adjusted HITs, vaccination data, and seroprevalence survey data, we find that no state has achieved herd immunity as of 20-September-2021. Significance StatementCOVID-19 will continue to threaten non-immune persons in the presence of ongoing disease transmission. We can estimate when sustained disease transmission will end by calculating the population-specific basic reproduction number [R]0, which relates to a herd immunity threshold (HIT), given by 1 - 1/[R]0. When the immune fraction of a population exceeds this threshold, sustained disease transmission becomes exponentially unlikely. Here, we report state-level [R]0 estimates indicating that disease transmission varies considerably across states. Our [R]0 estimates can also be used to determine HITs for the Delta variant of COVID-19. On the basis of Delta-adjusted HITs, vaccination data, and serological survey results, we find that no state has yet achieved herd immunity.","title":"Bayesian Inference of State-Level COVID-19 Basic Reproduction Numbers across the United States","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: New Jersey\\r\\ndate: 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\r\\nR0 value: 7.1\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Bayesian inference\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Wyoming\\r\\ndate: 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\r\\nR0 value: 2.3\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Bayesian inference","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"New Jersey\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"7.1\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Bayesian inference\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Wyoming\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.3\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Bayesian inference\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"New Jersey\\", \\"date\\": \\"21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"7.1\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"compartmental models via the next-generation matrix\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Wyoming\\", \\"date\\": \\"21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.3\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"compartmental models via the next-generation matrix\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2021","action":"change_main_cord_id","cluster_id":"187"},{"main_cord_uid":"6xntkvki","cord_uid":"6xntkvki","abstract":"COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly spread worldwide.

We associate these breaking points with a timeline of key containment measures taken by national and regional governments, applying time lags for the time from contagion to case detection, with their associated errors. Results show an early decrease of Rt that preceded the nationwide lockdown; a generalized, sharp decrease in Rt associated with such lockdown; a low impact of the strengthened lockdown, with a flattening of Rt evolution in high-incidence regions, and even increases in Rt at low-incidence regions; and an increase in Rt associated to the relaxation of the lockdown measures in ten regions. These results evidence the importance of generalized lockdown measures to contain COVID-19 spread, and the limited effect of the subsequent application of a stricter lockdown (restrictions to all non-essential economic activities). Most importantly, they highlight the importance of maintaining strong social distancing measures and strengthening public health control during lockdown de-escalation.","title":"COVID-19 effective reproduction number dropped during Spain\'s nationwide dropdown, then spiked at lower-incidence regions","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-09-09 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"b2f0pn3l","cord_uid":"b2f0pn3l","abstract":"The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission poses challenges for control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If the generation-interval distribution of asymptomatic transmission differs from that of symptomatic transmission, then estimates of the basic reproduction number which do not explicitly account for asymptomatic cases may be systematically biased. Specifically, if asymptomatic cases have a shorter generation interval than symptomatic cases, R0 will be over-estimated, and if they have a longer generation interval, R0 will be under-estimated. Estimates of the realized proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential phase also depend on asymptomatic generation intervals. Our analysis shows that understanding the temporal course of asymptomatic transmission can be important for assessing the importance of this route of transmission, and for disease dynamics.

Their provision is desirable and includes advocacy, training health and community care workers, policy development and mentorship. Objectives The THET J&J start-up grants provided an ideal opportunity to establish a partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH). The long term aim being to develop children\'s palliative care services in The Gambia. A needs assessment was carried out in early 2020. We hope reporting the results raises awareness of the gaps and possible solutions in LMIC. Methods The study took the form of a cross-sectional design with a focus on estimating the need for CPC and gaps at the country level. A mixed methods approach utilising both quantitative and qualitative data was used. Both primary and secondary data sources were used. The estimation of the need for CPC was based on estimation techniques using the prevalence and mortality of the specific diseases known to require palliative care. The response to the need and existing gaps were analysed using interviews and focus groups with key persons as well as survey data from service providers. Ethical approval for this study was given by the University of the Gambia, School of Medicine. Reference number R020 004 Results Five organisations completed a Capacity Self-Assessment Tool, 17 staff from 5 facilities were interviewed and 2 Focus Group Discussions were conducted (8 staff). The leading cause of death in children was heart disease, then lower respiratory infections and neonatal disorders, with HIV/AIDS being 5th, Tuberculosis 7th and cancer 9th. Under 5 mortality is 47.8 per 1,000 live births. It was not possible to estimate prevalence. Facility capacity assessment to provide CPC ranged from 23%-74%. Themes identified were a need to improve diagnostic ability;a desire for training;improve access and utilisation of medicines;and provide support for families. Training in Palliative care is on the nursing and medical students syllabus. Senior staff were keen for more training. Topics that staff felt anxious about were breaking bad news, anticipating palliative needs and use of medication. Conclusions The establishment of a training and mentoring service for staff in palliative care is required and desired. Paediatric diagnostic facilities need improved including equipment and access to specialist opinions eg an echocardiogram. in the main hospital in Banjul. The use of online Palliative training through lectures and modules, supported by scheduled in person visits is thought to be a good solution particularly in the current Covid-19 situation. 1 online lecture session has already taken place for 30 participants, supported by the MoH. This had good media coverage and promoted CPC awareness within the country. M.Sowe is currently undertaking a Palliative Care Diploma in Uganda partly funded by this grant.

We aimed to investigate options for early intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be unsuccessful. METHODS: We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0] of 1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb75, 2\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb70, or 2\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb75) and assuming 7\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb75% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R0 value. These scenarios included isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the asymptomatic fraction of infections (22\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb77%, 30\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb70%, 40\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb70%, and 50\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb70%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same control measures.

Compared with the baseline scenario, the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb73% (IQR 92\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb76-99\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb79) when R0 was 1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb75, by 93\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb70% (81\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb75-99\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb77) when R0 was 2\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb70, and by 78\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb72% (59\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb70 -94\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb74) when R0 was 2\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb75. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb70%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb75. INTERPRETATION: Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions, intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

However, what a good testing strategy is and whether the difference in testing strategy shows a meaningful, measurable impact on the COVID-19 epidemic remain unknown. Here, we showed that patterns of association between effective reproduction number (Rt) and test positivity rate can illuminate differences in testing situation among different areas, using global and local data from Japan. This association can also evaluate the adequacy of current testing systems and what information is captured in COVID-19 surveillance.

The basic reproduction number (R0), incubation period, and serial interval (SI) were calculated. Time-varying R was estimated to assess the effectiveness of control measures. Of the 135 cases detected, 53 (39.3%) were imported. The median age was 36 (range = 0.5-72) years. Forty-one (30.4%) and 13 (9.6%) were presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases, respectively. The median incubation period was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] = 5, range = 1-11), and the mean SI was 5.4 days (SD = 4.5; 95% CI: 4.3, 6.5). The reproduction number was between 3.9 and 6.0, and the doubling time was 1.3 days. The time-varying reproduction number (Rt) was below one (Rt = 0.91; 95% credible interval: 0.62, 1.32) by the 13th day of the epidemic. Epidemic control was achieved through a combination of public health measures, with emphasis on a test-isolate-trace approach supplemented by travel restrictions and moderate physical distancing measures but no actual lockdown. Regular and ongoing testing of high-risk groups to supplement the existing surveillance program and a phased easing of physical distancing measures has helped maintain suppression of the COVID-19 outbreak in Brunei, as evidenced by the identification of only six additional cases from April 5 to August 5, 2020.","title":"Epidemiological Investigation of the First 135 COVID-19 Cases in Brunei: Implications for Surveillance, Control, and Travel Restrictions","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Brunei\\r\\ndate: from March 9 to April 5, 2020\\r\\nR0 value: between 3.9 and 6.0\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Time-varying R","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Brunei\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"from March 9 to April 5, 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"between 3.9 and 6.0\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Time-varying R\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Brunei\\", \\"date\\": \\"March 9 to April 5, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"between 3.9 and 6.0\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"Epidemiological and clinical information\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"5wn7l61e","cord_uid":"5wn7l61e","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The required efforts, feasibility and predicted success of an intervention strategy against an infectious disease are partially determined by its basic reproduction number, R(0). In its simplest form R(0) can be understood as the product of the infectious period, the number of infectious contacts and the per-contact transmission probability, which in the case of vector-transmitted diseases necessarily extend to the vector stages. As vectors do not usually recover from infection, they remain infectious for life, which places high significance on the vector\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u201e\xa2s life expectancy. Current methods for estimating the R(0) for a vector-borne disease are mostly derived from compartmental modelling frameworks assuming constant vector mortality rates. We hypothesised that some of the assumptions underlying these models can lead to unrealistic high vector life expectancies with important repercussions for R(0) estimates. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we used a stochastic, individual-based model which allowed us to directly measure the number of secondary infections arising from one index case under different assumptions about vector mortality. Our results confirm that formulas based on age-independent mortality rates can overestimate R(0) by nearly 100% compared to our own estimate derived from first principles. We further provide a correction factor that can be used with a standard R(0) formula and adjusts for the discrepancies due to erroneous vector age distributions. CONCLUSION: Vector mortality rates play a crucial role for the success and general epidemiology of vector-transmitted diseases. Many modelling efforts intrinsically assume these to be age-independent, which, as clearly demonstrated here, can lead to severe over-estimation of the disease\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u201e\xa2s reproduction number. Our results thus re-emphasise the importance of obtaining field-relevant and species-dependent vector mortality rates, which in turn would facilitate more realistic intervention impact predictions.","title":"Robustness of the reproductive number estimates in vector-borne disease systems","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2018-12-17 00:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"bu43gmpc","cord_uid":"bu43gmpc","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The role of demographic factors, climatic conditions, school cycles, and connectivity patterns in shaping the spatio-temporal dynamics of pandemic influenza is not clearly understood. Here we analyzed the spatial, age and temporal evolution of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile, a southern hemisphere country covering a long and narrow strip comprising latitudes 17\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb0S to 56\xc3\u201a\xc2\xb0S. METHODS: We analyzed the dissemination patterns of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic across 15 regions of Chile based on daily hospitalizations for severe acute respiratory disease and laboratory confirmed A/H1N1 influenza infection from 01-May to 31-December, 2009. We explored the association between timing of pandemic onset and peak pandemic activity and several geographical and demographic indicators, school vacations, climatic factors, and international passengers. We also estimated the reproduction number (R) based on the growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset, estimated using maximum likelihood methods. RESULTS: While earlier pandemic onset was associated with larger population size, there was no association with connectivity, demographic, school or climatic factors. In contrast, there was a latitudinal gradient in peak pandemic timing, representing a 16-39-day lag in disease activity from the southern regions relative to the northernmost region (P < 0.001). Geographical differences in latitude of Chilean regions, maximum temperature and specific humidity explained 68.5% of the variability in peak timing (P = 0.01). In addition, there was a decreasing gradient in reproduction number from south to north Chile (P < 0.0001). The regional mean R estimates were 1.6-2.0, 1.3-1.5, and 1.2-1.3 for southern, central and northern regions, respectively, which were not affected by the winter vacation period. CONCLUSIONS: There was a lag in the period of most intense 2009 pandemic influenza activity following a South to North traveling pattern across regions of Chile, significantly associated with geographical differences in minimum temperature and specific humidity. The latitudinal gradient in timing of pandemic activity was accompanied by a gradient in reproduction number (P < 0.0001). Intensified surveillance strategies in colder and drier southern regions could lead to earlier detection of pandemic influenza viruses and improved control outcomes.","title":"The influence of climatic conditions on the transmission dynamics of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: A/H1N1 influenza\\r\\nlocation: Chile, southern region\\r\\ndate: 01-May to 31-December, 2009\\r\\nR0 value: 1.6-2.0\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: A/H1N1 influenza\\r\\nlocation: Chile, central region\\r\\ndate: 01-May to 31-December, 2009\\r\\nR0 value: 1.3-1.5\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: A/H1N1 influenza\\r\\nlocation: Chile, northern regions\\r\\ndate: 01-May to 31-December, 2009\\r\\nR0 value: 1.2-1.3\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"A/H1N1 influenza\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Chile, southern region\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"01-May to 31-December, 2009\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.6-2.0\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"A/H1N1 influenza\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Chile, central region\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"01-May to 31-December, 2009\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.3-1.5\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"A/H1N1 influenza\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Chile, northern regions\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"01-May to 31-December, 2009\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.2-1.3\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"growth rate of the exponential pandemic phase by date of symptoms onset\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"2009 A/H1N1 influenza\\", \\"location\\": \\"Chile\\", \\"date\\": \\"01-May to 31-December, 2009\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.6-2.0\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"maximum likelihood methods\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"2009 A/H1N1 influenza\\", \\"location\\": \\"Chile\\", \\"date\\": \\"01-May to 31-December, 2009\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.3-1.5\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"maximum likelihood methods\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"2009 A/H1N1 influenza\\", \\"location\\": \\"Chile\\", \\"date\\": \\"01-May to 31-December, 2009\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.2-1.3\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"maximum likelihood methods\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2012-11-13 05:00:00","cluster_id":"1177"},{"main_cord_uid":"fdwrrpnl","cord_uid":"fdwrrpnl","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Since the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic, Public Health England have developed a suite of real-time statistical models utilising enhanced pandemic surveillance data to nowcast and forecast a future pandemic. Their ability to track seasonal influenza and predict heightened winter healthcare burden in the light of high activity in Australia in 2017 was untested. METHODS: Four transmission models were used in forecasting the 2017/2018 seasonal influenza epidemic in England: a stratified primary care model using daily, region-specific, counts and virological swab positivity of influenza-like illness consultations in general practice (GP); a strain-specific (SS) model using weekly, national GP ILI and virological data; an intensive care model (ICU) using reports of ICU influenza admissions; and a synthesis model that included all data sources. For the first 12 weeks of 2018, each model was applied to the latest data to provide estimates of epidemic parameters and short-term influenza forecasts. The added value of pre-season population susceptibility data was explored. RESULTS: The combined results provided valuable nowcasts of the state of the epidemic.

Estimation and predictions varied according to the assumed levels of pre-season immunity. CONCLUSIONS: This exercise successfully applied a range of pandemic models to seasonal influenza. Forecasting early in the season remains challenging but represents a crucially important activity to inform planning.

National guidelines do not currently recommend testing students prior to campus arrival. However, the impact of presemester testing has not been studied. DESIGN: Dynamic SARS-CoV-2 transmission models are used to explore the effects of three presemester testing interventions. INTERVENTIONS: Testing of students 0, 1 and 2 times prior to campus arrival. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Number of active infections and time until isolation bed capacity is reached. SETTING: We set on-campus and off-campus populations to 7500 and 17 500 students, respectively. We assumed 2% prevalence of active cases at the semester start, and that one-third of infected students will be detected and isolated throughout the semester. Isolation bed capacity was set at 500. We varied disease transmission rates (R(0)=1.5, 2, 3, 4) to represent the effectiveness of mitigation strategies throughout the semester. RESULTS: Without presemester screening, peak number of active infections ranged from 4114 under effective mitigation strategies (R(0)=1.5) to 10 481 under ineffective mitigation strategies (R(0)=4), and exhausted isolation bed capacity within 10 (R(0)=4) to 25 days (R(0)=1.5). Mandating at least one test prior to campus arrival delayed the timing and reduced the size of the peak, while delaying the time until isolation bed capacity was reached. Testing twice in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies (R(0)=1.5) was the only scenario that did not exhaust isolation bed capacity during the semester. CONCLUSIONS: Presemester screening is necessary to avert early and large surges of active COVID-19 infections. Therefore, we recommend testing within 1 week prior to and on campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the peak outbreak, presemester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to significantly reduce outbreak size and preserve isolation bed capacity.","title":"Modelling the impact of presemester testing on COVID-19 outbreaks in university campuses","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-12-15 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"o5twfbsh","cord_uid":"o5twfbsh","abstract":"This study examined four countries Israel, United States, United Kingdom, and Serbia and present their possible vaccination trajectories into 2021.

Moreover, we estimated that the reporting rate for cases stemming from market-to-human transmission was 2-34 fold higher than that for cases stemming from human-to-human transmission, suggesting that contact history with the wet market played a key role in identifying COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our R estimate tied to market-to-human transmission had substantial uncertainty, but it was significantly lower compared with the reproduction number driving human-to-human transmission. Our results also suggest that asymptomatic and subclinical infections constitute a substantial component of the COVID-19 morbidity burden.","title":"Effect of a wet market on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission dynamics in China, 2019-2020","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: China\\r\\ndate: 2019-2020\\r\\nR0 value: 0.24  for market-to-human transmission\\r\\n%CI values: (95% CrI: 0.01-1.38)\\r\\nmethod: quantitative modeling analyses\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: China\\r\\ndate: 2019-2020\\r\\nR0 value: 2.37  for human-to-human transmission\\r\\n%CI values: (95% CrI: 2.08-2.71)\\r\\nmethod: quantitative modeling analyses","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"China\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"2019-2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"0.24  for market-to-human transmission\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CrI: 0.01-1.38)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"quantitative modeling analyses\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"China\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"2019-2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2.37  for human-to-human transmission\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CrI: 2.08-2.71)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"quantitative modeling analyses\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"China\\", \\"date\\": \\"2019-2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"0.24\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CrI: 0.01-1.38)\\", \\"method\\": \\"quantitative modeling analyses\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"China\\", \\"date\\": \\"2019-2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"2.37\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CrI: 2.08-2.71)\\", \\"method\\": \\"quantitative modeling analyses\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020","cluster_id":"69"},{"main_cord_uid":"ixtq6e46","cord_uid":"ixtq6e46","abstract":"In epidemiology, the effective reproduction number $R_e$ is used to characterize the growth rate of an epidemic outbreak. In this paper, we investigate properties of $R_e$ for a modified SEIR model of COVID-19 in the city of Houston, TX USA, in which the population is divided into low-risk and high-risk subpopulations. The response of $R_e$ to two types of control measures (testing and distancing) applied to the two different subpopulations is characterized. A nonlinear cost model is used for control measures, to include the effects of diminishing returns. We propose three types of heuristic strategies for mitigating COVID-19 that are targeted at reducing $R_e$, and we exhibit the tradeoffs between strategy implementation costs and number of deaths. We also consider two variants of each type of strategy: basic strategies, which consider only the effects of controls on $R_e$, without regard to subpopulation; and high-risk prioritizing strategies, which maximize control of the high-risk subpopulation. Results showed that of the three heuristic strategy types, the most cost-effective involved setting a target value for $R_e$ and applying sufficient controls to attain that target value. This heuristic led to strategies that begin with strict distancing of the entire population, later followed by increased testing. Strategies that maximize control on high-risk individuals were less cost-effective than basic strategies that emphasize reduction of the rate of spreading of the disease. The model shows that delaying the start of control measures past a certain point greatly worsens strategy outcomes. We conclude that the effective reproduction can be a valuable real-time indicator in determining cost-effective control strategies.","title":"Cost Effective Reproduction Number Based Strategies for Reducing Deaths from COVID-19","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-04-19 00:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"jsr6b9pb","cord_uid":"jsr6b9pb","abstract":"The spread of COVID-19 within a region in South East Asia has been modelled using a compartment model called SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered).

While lockdowns and physical distancing have proven effective for reducing COVID-19 transmission, there is still limited understanding of how NPI measures are reflected in indicators of human mobility. Further, there is a lack of understanding about how findings from high-income settings correspond to low and middle-income contexts. MethodsIn this study, we assess the relationship between indicators of human mobility, NPIs, and estimates of Rt, a real-time measure of the intensity of COVID-19 transmission. We construct a multilevel generalised linear mixed model, combining local disease surveillance data from subnational districts of Ghana with the timing of NPIs and indicators of human mobility from Google and Vodafone Ghana. FindingsWe observe a relationship between reductions in human mobility and decreases in Rt during the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Ghana. We find that the strength of this relationship varies through time, decreasing after the most stringent period of interventions in the early epidemic. InterpretationOur findings demonstrate how the association of NPI and mobility indicators with COVID-19 transmission may vary through time. Further, we demonstrate the utility of combining local disease surveillance data with large scale human mobility data to augment existing surveillance capacity and monitor the impact of NPI policies. Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and preprint archives for articles published in English that contained information about the COVID-19 pandemic published up to Nov 1, 2021, using the search terms \\"coronavirus\\", \\"CoV\\", \\"COVID-19\\", \\"mobility\\", \\"movement\\", and \\"flow\\". The data thus far suggests that NPI measures including physical distancing, reduction of travel, and use of personal protective equipment have been demonstrated to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Much of the existing research focuses on comparisons of NPI stringency with COVID-19 transmission among different high-income countries, or on high-income countries, leaving critical questions about the applicability of these findings to low- and middle-income settings. Added value of this studyWe used a detailed COVID-19 surveillance dataset from Ghana, and unique high resolution spatial data on human mobility from Vodafone Ghana as well as Google smartphone GPS location data. We show how human mobility and NPI stringency were associated with changes in the effective reproduction number (Rt). We further demonstrate how this association was strongest in the early COVID-19 outbreak in Ghana, decreasing after the relaxation of national restrictions. Implications of all the available evidenceThe change in association between human mobility, NPI stringency, and Rt may reflect a \\"decoupling\\" of NPI stringency and human mobility from disease transmission in Ghana as the COVID-19 epidemic progressed. This finding provides public health decision makers with important insights for the understanding of the utility of mobility data for predicting the spread of COVID-19.","title":"Estimating the relationship between mobility, non-pharmaceutical interventions, and COVID-19 transmission in Ghana","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"9yi3rv38","cord_uid":"9yi3rv38","abstract":"Multiple safe and effective vaccines and antiviral drugs have been approved or authorized for use against the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The effectiveness of these and other intervention measures is threatened by the emergence of numerous SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. We present a model for studying the transmission dynamics of two of these variants (Delta and Omicron) in the presence of vaccination, treatment of individuals with clinical symptoms of the disease and the use of face masks in the community. The model was fitted using daily case data for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States corresponding to the period starting from when Omicron first emerged (end of November 2021) to date. It is shown, based on simulating the model with the current COVID-19 data, that the reproduction number of the Delta variant (denoted by Rvd) is much smaller than one (Rvd = 0.28), while that of Omicron (denoted by Rvo) is approximately equal to unity (Rvo = 0.96). This shows that the Delta variant has essentially died out, and that Omicron is currently the predominant variant of concern in the United States. Furthermore, if the current baseline levels of the control measures being implemented in the United States are maintained, the Omicron variant will also be on a rapid decline (towards elimination). The analysis and simulations of the calibrated model show that vaccine-derived immunity can be achieved in the United States if at least 68% of the population is fully-vaccinated with either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. It is shown that the COVID-19 pandemic can be eliminated in the United States by June of 2022 if the current baseline level of the proportion of individuals that is fully-vaccinated is increased by about 20%. The threshold vaccination coverage needed to achieve the vaccine-derived herd immunity decreases if the vaccination program is combined with a face mask use strategy, particularly one that emphasizes the use of moderate to high quality masks (e.g., surgical or N95 masks). Greater reduction in disease burden (in comparison to the baseline scenario) are recorded if the very high quality N95 masks are prioritized in the community, followed by the moderately-effective surgical masks and then the lowly-effective cloth masks. We also showed that having high percentage of the populace wearing the moderately-effective surgical mask is more beneficial to the community than having low percentage of the populace wearing the highly-effective N95 masks (this result does not hold for the case when cloth masks compliance is compared with that of N95 masks). However, if a certain (fixed) percentage is to give up masking, our study showed that it is more beneficial if they give up wearing surgical masks and not N95 masks (in other words, in a head-to-head comparison, N95 is always superior than surgical mask). This study showed that waning natural and vaccine-derived immunity (if considered individually) offer marginal impact on disease burden, except for the case when they wane at a much faster rate (e.g., within three months), in comparison to the baseline (estimated to be within 9 months to a year). Greater reduction or increase in disease burden is recorded if both the vaccine-derived and natural immunity wane at the same time (rather than the case when we considered only one of them varying, while the other is at baseline). For instance, if both vaccine-derived and natural immunity wane within three months, a 14% increase in the peak daily cases will be recorded, in comparison to the baseline. For this case, where immunity wanes within three months, our study predicts another (but milder) Omicron wave in the United States that peaks around July 2022 (with the peak 72% lower than the original Omicron peak). Under this (fast waning) scenario, our study suggests that a fourth dose of the two mRNA vaccines would need to be approved in the United States to aid and accelerate the prospect of SARS-CoV-2 elimination in 2022. It is shown that while the treatment of symptomatic individuals has marginal effect in reducing daily cases of SARS-CoV-2, in comparison to the baseline, it has significant impact in reducing daily hospitalizations. It is further shown that, while treatment significantly reduces hospitalization, the prospects of COVID-19 elimination in the United States is more significantly enhanced if investments in control resources are focused on mask usage and vaccination rather than on treatment.","title":"Dynamics of the Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States: the battle of supremacy in the presence of vaccination, mask usage and antiviral treatment","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19, Delta variant\\r\\nlocation: United States\\r\\ndate: End of November 2021 to date\\r\\nR0 value: 0.28\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Model fitted using daily case data for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19, Omicron\\r\\nlocation: United States\\r\\ndate: End of November 2021 to date\\r\\nR0 value: 0.96\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: Model fitted using daily case data for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19, Delta variant\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"United States\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"End of November 2021 to date\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"0.28\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Model fitted using daily case data for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19, Omicron\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"United States\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"End of November 2021 to date\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"0.96\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"Model fitted using daily case data for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"United States\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"0.48\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"model for studying the transmission dynamics of two of these variants (Delta and Omicron) in the presence of vaccination, treatment of individuals with clinical symptoms of the disease and the use of face masks in the community\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2022-02-24 05:00:00","cluster_id":"145"},{"main_cord_uid":"kpc35qbs","cord_uid":"kpc35qbs","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic vary owing to local population density and policy measures. During decision-making, policymakers consider an estimate of the effective reproduction number Rt, which is the expected number of secondary infections spread by a single infected individual. OBJECTIVE: We propose a simple method for estimating the time-varying infection rate and the Rt. METHODS: We used a sliding window approach with a Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) model. We estimated the infection rate from the reported cases over a 7-day window to obtain a continuous estimation of Rt. A proposed adaptive SIR (aSIR) model was applied to analyze the data at the state and county levels. RESULTS: The aSIR model showed an excellent fit for the number of reported COVID-19 cases, and the 1-day forecast mean absolute prediction error was <2.6% across all states. However, the 7-day forecast mean absolute prediction error approached 16.2% and strongly overestimated the number of cases when the Rt was rapidly decreasing. The maximal Rt displayed a wide range of 2.0 to 4.5 across all states, with the highest values for New York (4.4) and Michigan (4.5). We found that the aSIR model can rapidly adapt to an increase in the number of tests and an associated increase in the reported cases of infection. Our results also suggest that intensive testing may be an effective method of reducing Rt.

If the confirmed case can be isolated in 3~8 days by widely performed testing, this pandemic could be suppressed without awaiting vaccination. If the mild outing restriction and vaccination are taken together, the isolation control time can be longer.

COVID-19 is a viral disease that is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which has no approved vaccine. The available control measures are non-pharmacological interventions like wearing face masks, social distancing, and lockdown which are being advocated for by the WHO. This work assesses the impact of non-pharmaceutical control measures (social distancing and use of face-masks) and mass testing on the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. A community-based transmission model for COVID-19 in Nigeria is formulated with observing social distancing, wearing face masks in public and mass testing. The model is parameterized using Nigeria data on COVID-19 in Nigeria. The basic reproduction number is found to be less than unity( R_0<1) when the compliance with intervention measures is moderate (50%[\xe2\u2030\xa4]<70%) and the testing rate per day is moderate (0.5[\xe2\u2030\xa4]{sigma}_2<0.7) or when the compliance with intervention measures is strict ([\xe2\u2030\xa5]70%) and the testing rate per day is poor ({sigma}_2=0.3). This implies that Nigeria will be able to halt the spread of COVID-19 under these two conditions. However, it will be easier to enforce strict compliance with intervention measures in the presence of poor testing rate due to the limited availability of testing facilities and manpower in Nigeria. Hence, this study advocates that Nigerian governments (Federal and States) should aim at achieving a testing rate of at least 0.3 per day while ensuring that all the citizens strictly comply with wearing face masks and observing social distancing in public.","title":"The role of mathematical model in curbing COVID-19 in Nigeria","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Nigeria\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: R_0<1\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: community-based transmission model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Nigeria\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"R_0<1\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"community-based transmission model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-07-25 00:00:00","action":"change_main_cord_id","cluster_id":"546"},{"main_cord_uid":"4gr6i8rf","cord_uid":"4gr6i8rf","abstract":"As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation declines causing the rate at which new infections occur to slow down. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected and removed from the susceptible subpopulation earlier. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold is reached. Here we fit epidemiological models with inbuilt distributions of susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks to estimate basic reproduction numbers (R_0) alongside coefficients of individual variation (CV) and the effects of containment strategies. Herd immunity thresholds are then calculated as 1-(1/R_0 )^(1/((1+CV^2 ) )) or 1-(1/R_0 )^(1/((1+2CV^2 ) )), depending on whether variation is on susceptibility or exposure. Our inferences result in herd immunity thresholds around 10-20%, considerably lower than the minimum coverage needed to interrupt transmission by random vaccination, which for R_0 higher than 2.5 is estimated above 60%. We emphasize that the classical formula, 1-1/R_0 , remains applicable to describe herd immunity thresholds for random vaccination, but not for immunity induced by infection which is naturally selective. These findings have profound consequences for the governance of the current pandemic given that some populations may be close to achieving herd immunity despite being under more or less strict social distancing measures.","title":"Herd immunity thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 estimated from unfolding epidemics","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-07-24 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"n4sc7g1u","cord_uid":"n4sc7g1u","abstract":"Mathematical modeling in epidemiology has a very important role in the study of the dynamics of an epidemic.

Our analysis to the data and the model yields a Basic Reproduction Number , which means that one individual infected by COVID-19 can produce three new infected individuals. Whereas our prediction shows that infected cases can reach to 37.82% and cases of death can reach to 0.49% of the population who remained in normal activities during the PSBB. The peaks of this case are estimated to occur in the 2nd week of August to the 1st week of October 2020. The fewer people who have normal activities, then the spread of COVID-19 is predicted to pass faster with smaller cases of infection and death. Conversely, the more people who have normal activities, then the spread of COVID-19 in South Kalimantan can take longer and take a higher number of victims.","title":"Pemodelan Matematika Penyebaran COVID-19 Di Provinsi Kalimantan Selatan","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"South Kalimantan Province\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"SIR Model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"pxhott2p","cord_uid":"pxhott2p","abstract":"COVID-19 pandemic has become a major threat to the country.

Here we use a modelling approach to reconstruct the full-spectrum dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan between 1 January and 8 March 2020 across 5 periods defined by events and interventions, on the basis of 32,583 laboratory-confirmed cases1. Accounting for presymptomatic infectiousness2, time-varying ascertainment rates, transmission rates and population movements3, we identify two key features of the outbreak: high covertness and high transmissibility. We estimate 87% (lower bound, 53%) of the infections before 8 March 2020 were unascertained (potentially including asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic individuals); and a basic reproduction number (R0) of 3.54 (95% credible interval 3.40-3.67) in the early outbreak, much higher than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)4,5. We observe that multipronged interventions had considerable positive effects on controlling the outbreak, decreasing the reproduction number to 0.28 (95% credible interval 0.23-0.33) and-by projection-reducing the total infections in Wuhan by 96.0% as of 8 March 2020. We also explore the probability of resurgence following the lifting of all interventions after 14 consecutive days of no ascertained infections; we estimate this probability at 0.32 and 0.06 on the basis of models with 87% and 53% unascertained cases, respectively-highlighting the risk posed by substantial covert infections when changing control measures. These results have important implications when considering strategies of continuing surveillance and interventions to eventually contain outbreaks of COVID-19.","title":"Reconstruction of the full transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Wuhan","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Wuhan (China)\\r\\ndate: 1 January and 8 March 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 3.54\\r\\n%CI values: (95% credible interval 3.40-3.67)\\r\\nmethod: modelling approach\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Wuhan (China)\\r\\ndate: as of 8 March 2022\\r\\nR0 value: 0.28\\r\\n%CI values: (95% credible interval 0.23-0.33)\\r\\nmethod: modelling approach","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Wuhan (China)\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"1 January and 8 March 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"3.54\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% credible interval 3.40-3.67)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"modelling approach\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Wuhan (China)\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"as of 8 March 2022\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"0.28\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% credible interval 0.23-0.33)\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"modelling approach\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\\", \\"location\\": \\"Wuhan (China)\\", \\"date\\": \\"between 1 January and 8 March 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"3.54\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% credible interval 3.40-3.67)\\", \\"method\\": \\"a modelling approach\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020","cluster_id":"238"},{"main_cord_uid":"w63jlt4s","cord_uid":"w63jlt4s","abstract":"The transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) becomes pandemic, but presents different patterns in the world.

Methods: We collected outbreak information from Singapore and Tianjin, China, reported from Jan.19-Feb.26 and Jan.21-Feb.27, respectively.

With regard to Covid-19, it is shown that if the control reproduction number is set to the basic reproduction number (say 6) of the dominant delta (B1.617.2) variant, vaccination alone, even under the most optimistic of assumptions about vaccine efficacy and high vaccine coverage, is very unlikely to lead to elimination of the disease. The model is not intended to be predictive but more an aid to understanding the relative importance of various biological and control parameters. For example, from a long-term perspective, it may be found that in the UK, through changes in societal behaviour (such as mask use, ventilation, and level of homeworking), without formal government interventions such as on-off lockdowns, the control reproduction number can still be maintained at a level significantly below the basic reproduction number.

Subsequently COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world. To contain the ensuing pandemic, numerous countries have implemented control measures related to international travel, including border closures, partial travel restrictions, entry or exit screening, and quarantine of travellers. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic on infectious disease and screening-related outcomes. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and COVID-19-specific databases, including the WHO Global Database on COVID-19 Research, the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the CDC COVID-19 Research Database on 26 June 2020. We also conducted backward-citation searches with existing reviews. Selection criteria: We considered experimental, quasi-experimental, observational and modelling studies assessing the effects of travel-related control measures affecting human travel across national borders during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also included studies concerned with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) as indirect evidence. Primary outcomes were cases avoided, cases detected and a shift in epidemic development due to the measures. Secondary outcomes were other infectious disease transmission outcomes, healthcare utilisation, resource requirements and adverse effects if identified in studies assessing at least one primary outcome. Data collection and analysis: One review author screened titles and abstracts; all excluded abstracts were screened in duplicate. Two review authors independently screened full texts. One review author extracted data, assessed risk of bias and appraised study quality. At least one additional review author checked for correctness of all data reported in the \'Risk of bias\' assessment, quality appraisal and data synthesis. For assessing the risk of bias and quality of included studies, we used the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool for observational studies concerned with screening, ROBINS-I for observational ecological studies and a bespoke tool for modelling studies. We synthesised findings narratively. One review author assessed certainty of evidence with GRADE, and the review author team discussed ratings. Main results: We included 40 records reporting on 36 unique studies. We found 17 modelling studies, 7 observational screening studies and one observational ecological study on COVID-19, four modelling and six observational studies on SARS, and one modelling study on SARS and MERS, covering a variety of settings and epidemic stages. Most studies compared travel-related control measures against a counterfactual scenario in which the intervention measure was not implemented. However, some modelling studies described additional comparator scenarios, such as different levels of travel restrictions, or a combination of measures. There were concerns with the quality of many modelling studies and the risk of bias of observational studies. Many modelling studies used potentially inappropriate assumptions about the structure and input parameters of models, and failed to adequately assess uncertainty. Concerns with observational screening studies commonly related to the reference test and the flow of the screening process. Studies on COVID-19. Travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel Eleven studies employed models to simulate a reduction in travel volume; one observational ecological study assessed travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Very low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests that when implemented at the beginning of the outbreak, cross-border travel restrictions may lead to a reduction in the number of new cases of between 26% to 90% (4 studies), the number of deaths (1 study), the time to outbreak of between 2 and 26 days (2 studies), the risk of outbreak of between 1% to 37% (2 studies), and the effective reproduction number (1 modelling and 1 observational ecological study). Low-certainty evidence from modelling studies suggests a reduction in the number of imported or exported cases of between 70% to 81% (5 studies), and in the growth acceleration of epidemic progression (1 study). Screening at borders with or without quarantine Evidence from three modelling studies of entry and exit symptom screening without quarantine suggests delays in the time to outbreak of between 1 to 183 days (very low-certainty evidence) and a detection rate of infected travellers of between 10% to 53% (low-certainty evidence). Six observational studies of entry and exit screening were conducted in specific settings such as evacuation flights and cruise ship outbreaks. Screening approaches varied but followed a similar structure, involving symptom screening of all individuals at departure or upon arrival, followed by quarantine, and different procedures for observation and PCR testing over a period of at least 14 days. The proportion of cases detected ranged from 0% to 91% (depending on the screening approach), and the positive predictive value ranged from 0% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). The outcomes, however, should be interpreted in relation to both the screening approach used and the prevalence of infection among the travellers screened; for example, symptom-based screening alone generally performed worse than a combination of symptom-based and PCR screening with subsequent observation during quarantine. Quarantine of travellers Evidence from one modelling study simulating a 14-day quarantine suggests a reduction in the number of cases seeded by imported cases; larger reductions were seen with increasing levels of quarantine compliance ranging from 277 to 19 cases with rates of compliance modelled between 70% to 100% (very low-certainty evidence). Authors\' conclusions: With much of the evidence deriving from modelling studies, notably for travel restrictions reducing cross-border travel and quarantine of travellers, there is a lack of \'real-life\' evidence for many of these measures. The certainty of the evidence for most travel-related control measures is very low and the true effects may be substantially different from those reported here. Nevertheless, some travel-related control measures during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a positive impact on infectious disease outcomes. Broadly, travel restrictions may limit the spread of disease across national borders. Entry and exit symptom screening measures on their own are not likely to be effective in detecting a meaningful proportion of cases to prevent seeding new cases within the protected region; combined with subsequent quarantine, observation and PCR testing, the effectiveness is likely to improve. There was insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of travel-related quarantine on its own. Some of the included studies suggest that effects are likely to depend on factors such as the stage of the epidemic, the interconnectedness of countries, local measures undertaken to contain community transmission, and the extent of implementation and adherence.","title":"Travel-related control measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"66eqh79t","cord_uid":"66eqh79t","abstract":"Summary Epidemics of novel or re-emerging infectious diseases have quickly spread globally via air travel, as highlighted by pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 (pH1N1). Federal, state, and local public health responders must be able to plan for and respond to these events at aviation points of entry. The emergence of a novel influenza virus and its spread to the United States were simulated for February 2009 from 55 international metropolitan areas using three basic reproduction numbers (R 0): 1.53, 1.70, and 1.90. Empirical data from the pH1N1 virus were used to validate our SEIR model. Time to entry to the U.S. during the early stages of a prototypical novel communicable disease was predicted based on the aviation network patterns and the epidemiology of the disease. For example, approximately 96% of origins (R 0 of 1.53) propagated a disease into the U.S. in under 75 days, 90% of these origins propagated a disease in under 50 days. An R 0 of 1.53 reproduced the pH1NI observations. The ability to anticipate the rate and location of disease introduction into the U.S. provides greater opportunity to plan responses based on the scenario as it is unfolding. This simulation tool can aid public health officials to assess risk and leverage resources efficiently.","title":"A model-based tool to predict the propagation of infectious disease via airports","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"novel influenza\\", \\"location\\": \\"55 international metropolitan areas\\", \\"date\\": \\"February 2009\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.53\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"1.70\\", \\"method\\": \\"SEIR model\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"novel influenza\\", \\"location\\": \\"55 international metropolitan areas\\", \\"date\\": \\"February 2009\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"1.90\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"SEIR model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2012-01-31 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"zd4c3nep","cord_uid":"zd4c3nep","abstract":"This paper deals with the mathematical modeling of the second wave of COVID-19 and verifies the current Omicron variant pandemic data in India.

In the West, even with peri-operative chemotherapy, 5-year survival rate is approximately 40%. GC is a heterogeneous disease, well characterized by different molecular classifications, all having in common the role of the immune system and a T-cell inflamed phenotype across all subtypes. The anti-PD-L1 Av antibody has demonstrated efficacy in GC with response rates of around 10% in the refractory setting. The addition of other immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy have demonstrated efficacy in the metastatic setting. The combination of Av to perioperative chemotherapy may increase pathological responses by a synergistic effect, and then improving the survival (OS).

A stochastic point process simulation model for simulating epidemics, a maximum-likelihood estimation model, an exponential growth rate model for calculating the basic reproduction number (R0), and functions for generating graphical representations of the simulations were utilized. Geographical area definition, population size, the number of initial infected individuals, period of simulation, parameters accounting for the radius of spread like masks usage, mobility level, intrinsic viral virulence, average infectious period, fraction of population vaccinated, time of vaccination, the efficacy of the vaccine, presence or absence of quarantine centers, time of establishment of quarantine centers, the efficacy of case detection and average time to quarantine from the detection of the infection were considered. RESULTS: When the defined parameters were input, the model performed successfully producing the epidemic curve, R0 and an animation of infection spread. It was found that when parameters of known epidemics such as COVID-19 in California, Texas and, Florida were input, the epidemic curve generated was comparable to the epidemic curve in reality. CONCLUSION: This model can be utilized by many countries to visualize the effects of various mitigation strategies applied in their stage of disease and for policy makers to make informed decisions. It is applicable to many infectious diseases and hence can be used for research and educational purposes.","title":"A stochastic process based modular tool-box for simulating COVID-19 infection spread","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"California, Texas and, Florida\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"exponential growth rate model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2022-03-05 00:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"fbl13xq7","cord_uid":"fbl13xq7","abstract":"This paper addresses the problem of describing the spread of COVID-19 by a mathematical model introducing all the possible control actions as prevention (informative campaign, use of masks, social distancing, vaccination) and medication.

This distinction is particularly important in the current pandemic, due to the fundamental the role of asymptomatic subjects in the virus diffusion. The influence of the control actions is considered in analysing the model, from the calculus of the equilibrium points to the determination of the reproduction number. This choice is motivated by the fact that the available organised data have been collected since from the end of February 2020, and almost simultaneously containment measures, increasing in typology and effectiveness, have been applied.

We simulated the future trajectory of the epidemic under current conditions, projected the impact of policy interventions, and analyzed the implications for healthcare capacity. METHODS: Our study was based on the first month of publicly accessible data on new confirmed daily cases. A susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model for COVID-19 was employed to compare the current dynamics of the disease with those predicted under various scenarios. RESULTS: The fitted model for the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Bali indicated an effective reproduction number of 1.4. Interventions have decreased the possible maximum number of cases from 71 125 on day 86 to 22 340 on day 119, and have prolonged the doubling time from about 9 days to 21 days. This corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in transmissions from cases of mild infections. There will be 2780 available hospital beds, and at the peak (on day 132), the number of severe cases is estimated to be roughly 6105. Of these cases, 1831 will need intensive care unit (ICU) beds, whereas the number of currently available ICU beds is roughly 446.

The findings suggested that many countries successfully kept the reproduction number R_t less than 1 (e.g., Belgium, Germany, Spain, and France) while other countries exhibited R_t greater than 1 (e.g., United Kingdom, Cyprus). Based on the assumed reopen strategy, this study also revealed that a 2-week delay in response predicted approximately 2,000 deaths and 200,000 cases (daily peak value), while a 3-week delay predicted approximately 5,000 deaths and 600,000 cases (daily peak value).

The peak of the epidemics has not yet been reached and it is expected to be delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. Objective: We have modeled the Covid-19 outbreak progression in Italian Regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemics. Primary and Secondary Measures: In our models, we have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1month period and also by using day by day assessment, based on single observations. We used the susceptible exposed infected removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. Results. The two methods provide agreements of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, in Lombardy each infected person has involved other 5 people (4.94 based on data of March 22nd) compared to a value of R0=2.68 reported in the Chinese city of Whuan. According to our model and Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche reach an R0 value up to 4. The R0 is 3.7 for Lazio and 3.6 for Campania region, where this latter shows the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.5), Sicily (3.4), Abruzzo (3.4), Calabria (3.1), Basilicata (2.5) and Molise (2.4).

Since 2017, the Bangladeshi government is providing shelter to a huge number of Rohingya refugees, and now in this COVID-19 pandemic, the government is to provide all necessities and medical supports to this population, while the country hardly can fulfill all rights of her own population. This study analyzes the SARS-CoV-2 situation in the Rohingya refugee camps at Cox\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Bazar and found that the authority has done a great job taking control over the murrain compared to the host and over-all the worldwide situation. Although taken precautions are good enough till now, more detailed and pragmatic preparedness should be adopted for the worst scenario in case. Last but not least, this success would not be possible without the help of other non-governmental and international voluntary and professional organizations. ABSTRACT: Background: Bangladesh hosts more than 800,000 Rohingya refugees from Myanmar. The low health immunity, lifestyle, access to good healthcare services, and social-security cause this population to be at risk of far more direct effects of COVID-19 than the host population. Therefore, evidence-based forecasting of the COVID-19 burden is vital in this regard. In this study, we aimed to forecast the COVID-19 obligation among the Rohingya refugees of Bangladesh to keep up with the disease outbreak\xe2\u20ac\u2122s pace, health needs, and disaster preparedness. Methodology and Findings: To estimate the possible consequences of COVID-19 in the Rohingya camps of Bangladesh, we used a modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model. All of the values of different parameters used in this model were from the Bangladesh Government\xe2\u20ac\u2122s database and the relevant emerging literature. We addressed two different scenarios, i.e., the best-fitting model and the good-fitting model with unique consequences of COVID-19. Our best fitting model suggests that there will be reasonable control over the transmission of the COVID-19 disease. At the end of December 2020, there will be only 169 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Rohingya refugee camps. The average basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) has been estimated to be 0.7563. Conclusions: Our analysis suggests that, due to the extensive precautions from the Bangladesh government and other humanitarian organizations, the coronavirus disease will be under control if the maintenance continues like this. However, detailed and pragmatic preparedness should be adopted for the worst scenario.","title":"SARS-CoV-2 and Rohingya Refugee Camp, Bangladesh: Uncertainty and How the Government Took Over the Situation","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Rohingya Refugee Camp, Bangladesh\\r\\ndate: end of December 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 0.7563\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Rohingya Refugee Camp, Bangladesh\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"end of December 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"0.7563\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Rohingya refugee camps of Bangladesh\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) transmission model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2021-02-05 00:00:00","cluster_id":"1506"},{"main_cord_uid":"sy1eztce","cord_uid":"sy1eztce","abstract":"Global efforts to prevent the spread of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in early 2020 focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing; policies that aim to reduce transmission by changing mixing patterns between people. As countries have implemented these interventions, aggregated location data from mobile phones have become an important source of real-time information about human mobility and behavioral changes on a population level. Human activity measured using mobile phones reflects the aggregate behavior of a subset of people, and although metrics of mobility are related to contact patterns between people that spread the coronavirus, they do not provide a direct measure. In this study, we use results from a nowcasting approach from 1,396 counties across the US between January 22nd, 2020 and July 9th, 2020 to determine the effective reproductive number (R(t)) along an urban/rural gradient. For each county, we compare the time series of R(t) values with mobility proxies from mobile phone data from Camber Systems, an aggregator of mobility data from various providers in the United States. We show that the reproduction number is most strongly associated with mobility proxies for change in the travel into counties compared to baseline, but that the relationship weakens considerably after the initial 15 weeks of the epidemic, consistent with the emergence of a more complex ecosystem of local policies and behaviors including masking. Importantly, we highlight potential issues in the data generation process, representativeness and equity of access which must be addressed to allow for general use of these data in public health.","title":"The relationship between human mobility measures and SAR-Cov-2 transmission varies by epidemic phase and urbanicity: results from the United States","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-04-20 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"61o5f82j","cord_uid":"61o5f82j","abstract":"BackgroundMonitoring the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) of the disease is useful in determining whether there is sustained transmission in a population.

ResultsAlthough Hangzhou had fewer number of cases than Shenzhen, Shenzhen had higher proportion of imported cases than Hangzhou (83% vs 29%). Since the epidemic of COVID-19 in Shenzhen was dominated by imported cases, Rt was kept below unity through time. On the contrary, Rt was greater than unity in Hangzhou from 16 January to 7 February due to the surge in local cases. Credits to the Wuhan lockdown and outbreak response measures following the local lockdown, Rt decreased steadily and dropped below unity in mid-February. ConclusionThe lockdown measures and local outbreak responses helped reduce the potential of local transmission in Hangzhou and Shenzhen.

Yet, the power and limitations of such strategies remain unquantified. Here, we develop a simulation study to analyze Covid-19 transmission on three real-life contact networks from a workplace, a primary school and a high school in France, gathered by SocioPatterns, and assess the impact of organization strategies. Investigated strategies include rotations, which consist in partitioning the individuals into two groups, with a presence switch between groups on a weekly or daily frequency ; and On-Off, which consist in keeping everybody together but alternating presence and telecommuting periods. Assuming baseline non pharmaceutical interventions and reactive isolation of symptomatic cases, all strategies where assessed based on a selection of criteria (outbreak probability, outbreak size, and delay before outbreak) and for reproduction numbers ranging 0.5-2. Our results are clear: whatever the network used, the ranking of the strategies based on their ability to mitigate epidemic propagation in the network from a first index case is always the same, namely, from best to worst: Rotation week-by-week, Rotation day-by-day, On-Off week-by-week, and On-Off day-by-day. The advantage of a weekly alternation over a daily alternation, despite significant, is very slight: for the attack rate when there is an outbreak in a high school for example, the numbers for On-Off are 16.8 vs. 18.4 (out of 327 individuals), a 9% improvement. Our results suggest that when the effective reproduction number R within the network is less than 1.34, therefore assuming concurrent implementation of social distancing and other non pharmaceutical interventions, all four strategies efficiently control the outbreak by decreasing effective R to less than 1; the choice between them should therefore be guided by considerations of practical feasibility.","title":"Analysis of mitigation of Covid-19 outbreaks in workplaces and schools by hybrid telecommuting","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-11-12 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"ajtq33sh","cord_uid":"ajtq33sh","abstract":"AIM: Comprehensive case investigation and contact tracing are crucial to prevent community spread of COVID-19.

METHODS: A centralized contact tracing system was developed to support data linkage, cross-jurisdictional coordination, and follow-up of contacts\' health status. We illustrated the process of how digital tools support contact tracing and management of COVID-19 cases and measured the timeliness from case detection to contact monitoring to evaluate system performance. RESULTS: Among the 8051 close contacts of the 487 confirmed cases (16.5 close contacts/case, 95% CI [13.9-19.1]), the median elapsed time from last exposure to quarantine was three days (IQR 1-5). By implementing the approach of self-reporting using automatic text-messages and web-app, the percentage of health status updates from self-reporting increased from 22.5% to 61.5%. The high proportion of secondary cases detected via contact tracing (88%) might reduce the R0 to under one and minimize the impact of local transmission in the community. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive contact tracing and management with complementary technology would still be a pillar of strategies for containing outbreaks during de-escalation or early in the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic.","title":"Contact tracing with digital assistance in Taiwan\'s COVID-19 outbreak response","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"edpxab9w","cord_uid":"edpxab9w","abstract":"Intestinal microbiota can indirectly modulate airway physiology and immunity through the gut-lung axis. Recent microbiome studies indicate that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibit a specific intestinal dysbiosis that is closely associated with the disease pathophysiology. Therefore, rebalancing the intestinal microbiome using probiotics may be effective for controlling COVID-19. However, the rationale for using probiotics in COVID-19 remains unclear. In the present study, an in vitro cytokine response assay was conducted, followed by a single-arm, double-blind, prospective trial to evaluate the immunological efficacy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria against COVID-19. The present study focused on Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum), Bifidobacterium longum and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, which exhibit robust protective effects against infection with respiratory RNA viruses. Considering the feasibility of long-term daily intake for prophylactic purposes, healthy uninfected individuals were enrolled as subjects. Our previous pilot trial demonstrated that oral Qingfei Paidu decoction (QFPD), a Chinese herbal medicine formulated specifically against COVID-19, upregulates plasma TNF-\xc3\u017d\xc2\xb1, IL-1\xc3\u017d\xc2\xb2, IL-18 and IL-8. Therefore, the present study utilized the cytokine changes induced by QFPD to define the innate cytokine index QICI [=(TNF-\xc3\u017d\xc2\xb1) x (IL-1\xc3\u017d\xc2\xb2) x (IL-18) x (IL-8)/(IL-6)] as an indicator of the anti-COVID-19 immunomodulatory potential of the lactic acid bacteria. A total of 20 eligible volunteers were enrolled, 18 of whom completed the intervention. L. plantarum demonstrated a strikingly high innate cytokine index in all subjects in the in vitro cytokine response assay. In the subsequent trial, oral intake of L. plantarum significantly increased the innate cytokine index (mean fold change, 17-fold; P=0.0138) and decreased the plasma level of IL-6 (P=0.0128), a key driver of complex immune dysregulation in COVID-19, as compared with the baseline. The cytokine index increased in 16 of 18 subjects (88.9%) with considerable individual differences in the fold change (1- to 128-fold). In line with these innate cytokine changes, L. plantarum ingestion significantly enhanced the activity of natural killer cells. By contrast, oral B. longum failed to induce a significant increase in the innate cytokine index (mean fold change, 2-fold; P=0.474) as compared with the baseline. In conclusion, L. plantarum demonstrated superior QFPD-like immunomodulatory ability and mimicked the blood cytokine environment produced by early immune responses to viral infection. Daily consumption of L. plantarum as an anti-COVID-19 probiotic may be a possible option for preventing COVID-19 during the pandemic.

We explore the impact of secular changes in diagnostic testing and reporting on estimates of R0 and Rt using simulated data. We then compare these patterns to data on reported cases of coronavirus disease and testing practices from different states in the United States from March 4 to August 30, 2020. We find that changes in testing practices and delays in reporting can result in biased estimates of R0 and Rt. Examination of changes in the daily number of tests conducted and the percent of patients testing positive may be helpful for identifying the potential direction of bias. Changes in diagnostic testing and reporting processes should be monitored and taken into consideration when interpreting estimates of the reproductive number of coronavirus disease.","title":"The Impact of Changes in Diagnostic Testing Practices on Estimates of COVID-19 Transmission in the United States","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"6sqgqttc","cord_uid":"6sqgqttc","abstract":"The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March, 2020 and rapidly spread to over 210 countries and territories around the world. By December 24, there are over 77M cumulative confirmed cases with more than 1.72M deaths worldwide. To mathematically describe the dynamic of the COVID-19 pandemic, we propose a time-dependent SEIR model considering the incubation period. Furthermore, we take immunity, reinfection, and vaccination into account and propose the SEVIS model. Unlike the classic SIR based models with constant parameters, our dynamic models not only predicts the number of cases, but also monitors the trajectories of changing parameters, such as transmission rate, recovery rate, and the basic reproduction number. Tracking these parameters, we observe the significant decrease in the transmission rate in the U.S. after the authority announced a series of orders aiming to prevent the spread of the virus, such as closing non-essential businesses and lockdown restrictions. Months later, as restrictions being gradually lifted, we notice a new surge of infection emerges as the transmission rates show increasing trends in some states. Using our epidemiology models, people can track, timely monitor, and predict the COVID-19 pandemic with precision. To illustrate and validate our model, we use the national level data (the U.S.) and the state level data (New York and North Dakota), and the resulting relative prediction errors for the infected group and recovered group are mostly lower than 0.5%. We also simulate the long-term development of the pandemic based on our proposed models to explore when the crisis will end under certain conditions.","title":"Toward the Impact of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions and Vaccination on the COVID-19 Pandemic With Time-Dependent SEIR Model","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021-03-18 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"q4jbqsh1","cord_uid":"q4jbqsh1","abstract":"World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

The inadequacy of an open-loop approach in controlling the disease spread is validated via numerical simulations and a robust closed-loop control methodology using sliding mode control is also presented. The proposed SMC strategy could bring the basic reproduction number closer to 1 from an initial value of 2.5, thus limiting the exposed and infected individuals to a controllable threshold value.

Risk diagrams at the regional level are useful to observe heterogeneity on COVID-19 penetration and spreading in some countries, which is essential during deconfinement processes. During the pandemic, there have been significant differences seen in countries reporting case criterion and detection capacity. Therefore, we have introduced estimations about the real number of infectious cases that allows us to have a broader view and to better estimate the risk.

We present a base mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in India and its neighbour, Pakistan. The base model, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, is parameterized using cumulative COVID-19 mortality data from each of the two countries. The model was used to assess the population-level impact of the control and mitigation strategies implemented in the two countries (notably community lockdowns, use of face masks, and social-distancing). Numerical simulations of the basic model indicate that, based on the current baseline levels of the control and mitigation strategies implemented, the pandemic trajectory in India is on a downward trend (as characterized by the reproduction number of the disease dynamics in India below, but close to, unity). This downward trend will be reversed, and India will be recording mild outbreaks (i.e., pandemic waves), if the control and mitigation strategies are relaxed from their current levels (e.g., relaxed to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are increased by 20% or 40% from their current baseline values). Our simulations suggest that India could record up to 460,000 cumulative deaths by early September 2021 under the baseline levels of the control strategies implemented (up to 25,000 of the projected deaths could be averted if the control and mitigation measures are strengthened to the extent that the associated community transmission parameters are reduced by 20% from their baseline values). Our simulations show that the pandemic in Pakistan is much milder, with an estimated projected cumulative mortality of about 24,000 by early September 2021 under the baseline scenario. The basic model was extended to assess the impact of back-and-forth mobility between the two countries. Simulations of the resulting metapopulation model show that the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan increases with increasing values of the average time residents of India spend in Pakistan. In particular, it is shown that the India- to-Pakistan mobility pattern may trigger a fourth wave of the pandemic in Pakistan (under certain mobility scenarios), with daily mortality peaking in mid-August to mid-September of 2021. Under the respective baseline control scenarios, our simulations show that the back-and-forth mobility between India and Pakistan could delay the time-to-elimination of the COVID-19 pandemic in the two countries by three to five months (specifically, under the respective baseline scenarios, elimination could be delayed in India and Pakistan to November 2022 and July 2022, respectively).","title":"Dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India and Pakistan: A metapopulation modelling approach","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2021"},{"main_cord_uid":"utng9v48","cord_uid":"utng9v48","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The isolation of symptomatic cases and tracing of contacts has been used as an early COVID-19 containment measure in many countries, with additional physical distancing measures also introduced as outbreaks have grown. To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures-including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing-might be required to reduce transmission. We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence. METHODS: For this mathematical modelling study, we used a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, or other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40\xc3\u0192\xc2\xa2\xc3\u201a\xe2\u201a\xac\xc3\u201a\xcb\u2020162 UK participants. We simulated the effect of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing, and physical distancing scenarios. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated reduction in the effective reproduction number and the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies. RESULTS: We estimated that combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone: mean transmission reduction of 2% for mass random testing of 5% of the population each week, 29% for self-isolation alone of symptomatic cases within the household, 35% for self-isolation alone outside the household, 37% for self-isolation plus household quarantine, 64% for self-isolation and household quarantine with the addition of manual contact tracing of all contacts, 57% with the addition of manual tracing of acquaintances only, and 47% with the addition of app-based tracing only. If limits were placed on gatherings outside of home, school, or work, then manual contact tracing of acquaintances alone could have an effect on transmission reduction similar to that of detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where 1000 new symptomatic cases that met the definition to trigger contact tracing occurred per day, we estimated that, in most contact tracing strategies, 15\xc3\u0192\xc2\xa2\xc3\u201a\xe2\u201a\xac\xc3\u201a\xcb\u2020000-41\xc3\u0192\xc2\xa2\xc3\u201a\xe2\u201a\xac\xc3\u201a\xcb\u2020000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day. INTERPRETATION: Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimated that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number lower than 1 in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission.

The main purpose of this study is to provide a basis for policy advice on border restrictions and control measures in response to outbreaks that may occur during the vaccination roll-out. The model can be used to estimate the theoretical population immunity threshold, which represents a point in the vaccine rollout at which border restrictions and other controls could be removed and only small, occasional outbreaks would take place. We find that, with a basic reproduction number of 6, approximately representing the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, and under baseline vaccine effectiveness assumptions, reaching the population immunity threshold would require close to 100% of the total population to be vaccinated. Since this coverage is not likely to be achievable in practice, relaxing controls completely would risk serious health impacts. However, the higher vaccine coverage is, the more collective protection the population has against adverse health outcomes from COVID-19, and the easier it will become to control outbreaks. There remains considerable uncertainty in model outputs, in part because of the potential for the evolution of new variants. If new variants arise that are more transmissible or vaccine resistant, an increase in vaccine coverage will be needed to provide the same level of protection.","title":"A COVID-19 vaccination model for Aotearoa New Zealand","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2022-02-17 05:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"4izymiy4","cord_uid":"4izymiy4","abstract":"Population density, behaviour and cultural habits strongly influence the spread of pathogens. Consequently, key epidemiological parameters may vary from country to country. Confirmed COVID-19 cases in in China have been used to estimate those parameters, that vary largely (reviewed in 1). The estimates also depend on testing frequency and case definitions that are prone to change during ongoing epidemics, providing additional uncertainties. The rise in fatal cases due to SARS-CoV2 could be a more reliable parameter, since missing of deaths is less likely. In the absence of changes in the management of severe COVID-19 cases, the rise in death cases should be proportional to the rise in virus infections. Although the fluctuating low numbers of fatal cases very early in the epidemic may lead to some uncertainty, more than 100 deaths per day are reported since 10.03.2020 in Italy and since 21.03.2020 in the US. Therefore, the dynamics of deaths were analysed to estimate the daily reproduction numbers (Rt) and the effectiveness of control measures. Thus, our analysis provides evidence that basic epidemiological parameters differ between countries to an extent compromising epidemiological predictions of the pandemic. It also suggests that suppression of spread in Italy and the US may be more difficult to achieve. Although we assume that variations in social behaviour are responsible for the different estimates of R0, selection of more rapidly spreading variants of SARS-CoV-2 cannot be excluded. Despite uncertainty in the reliability of the data used and lack of information on possible changes in the effectiveness of registration of COVID-19 deaths during the observation period, our findings should be considered as a working hypothesis demanding further investigations. As the number of deaths rapidly increases worldwide, we encourage more sophisticated modelling of the epidemic based on the dynamics of death cases by experts in the field.","title":"Determination of daily reproduction numbers of SARS-CoV2 based on death cases suggests more rapid initial spread in Italy and the United States","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020-03-31 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"v4mbry22","cord_uid":"v4mbry22","abstract":"As reported by the World Health Organization, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the causative virus of Wuhan pneumonia of unknown etiology by Chinese authorities on 7 January, 2020.

The sparseness of Covid-19 infections in the United States was analyzed at scales spanning from 10 to 2,600 km (county to continental scale). Spatial evolution of Covid-19 cases in the United States followed multifractal scaling. A rapid increase in the spatial correlation was identified early in the outbreak (March to April). Then, the increase continued at a slower rate and approached the spatial correlation of human population. Instead of adopting agent-based models that require tracking of individuals, a kernel-modulated approach is developed to characterize the dynamic spreading of disease in a multifractal distributed susceptible population. Multiphase Covid-19 epidemics were reasonably reproduced by the proposed kernel-modulated susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model. The work explained the fact that while the reproduction number was reduced due to nonpharmaceutical interventions (e.g., masks, social distancing, etc.), subsequent multiple epidemic waves still occurred; this was due to an increase in susceptible population flow following a relaxation of travel restrictions and corollary stay-at-home orders.

To end this ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to implement multiple population-wide policies like social distancing, testing more people and contact tracing. To predict the course of the pandemic and come up with a strategy to control it effectively, a compartmental model has been established. The following six stages of infection are taken into consideration: susceptible (S), asymptomatic infected (A), clinically ill or symptomatic infected (I), quarantine (Q), isolation (J) and recovered (R), collectively termed as SAIQJR. The qualitative behavior of the model and the stability of biologically realistic equilibrium points are investigated in terms of the basic reproduction number. We performed sensitivity analysis with respect to the basic reproduction number and obtained that the disease transmission rate has an impact in mitigating the spread of diseases. Moreover, considering the non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical intervention strategies as control functions, an optimal control problem is implemented to mitigate the disease fatality. To reduce the infected individuals and to minimize the cost of the controls, an objective functional has been constructed and solved with the aid of Pontryagin\xc3\xa2\xe2\u201a\xac\xe2\u201e\xa2s maximum principle. The implementation of optimal control strategy at the start of a pandemic tends to decrease the intensity of epidemic peaks, spreading the maximal impact of an epidemic over an extended time period. Extensive numerical simulations show that the implementation of intervention strategy has an impact in controlling the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic. Further, our numerical solutions exhibit that the combination of three controls are more influential when compared with the combination of two controls as well as single control. Therefore, the implementation of all the three control strategies may help to mitigate novel coronavirus disease transmission at this present epidemic scenario.

The number of confirmed cases has also been increased in India in the past few weeks. The predictions for the COVID-19 can provide insights into the epidemiology of the disease, which helps policymakers to check health system capacities. Methods: We obtained data on daily confirmed, recovered and death cases for a period of 21 days and have implemented the exponential growth model to predict future cases for all the three components. The mathematical model was used to calculate the average reproduction number and herd immunity. We estimated the number of active cases till the 30th of April. We have also tried to analyze the public health capacity to combat COVID-19 in India. Results: If the exponential growth in the number of cases continues then the total number of active cases will be 2,49,635 until the end of April. The reproduction number for COVID-19 in India was found to be 2.56 and herd immunity as 61%. The cumulative cases predicted by the mathematical model was 1,20,203. Discussion: This prediction provides an alarming situation for India in terms of public health preparedness. The number of tests is needed to increase to detect all the cases of COVID-19 in India. Though some serious preventive measures have been implemented, but India should be ready to face any sudden community outbreak.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the probability of reinfection in the recovered class and the model equations, which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium state for the coronavirus disease. METHODS: The model differential equation was evaluated for the disease-free equilibrium for the case of reinfection as well as the existence and stability criteria for the disease, using the model proportions. This evaluation shows that the criteria for a local or worldwide asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number (R0=0) were satisfied. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population, as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes (ie, B=0). RESULTS: With a total of about 900,000 infected cases worldwide, numerical simulations for this study were carried out to complement the analytical results and investigate the effect that the implementation of quarantine and observation procedures has on the projection of further virus spread. CONCLUSIONS: As shown by the results, the proportion of the infected population, in the absence of a curative vaccination, will continue to grow worldwide; meanwhile, the recovery rate will continue slowly, which means that the ratio of infection rate to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded. Most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population, which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.","title":"Estimation of the Probability of Reinfection With COVID-19 by the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed-Undetectable-Susceptible Model","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"unanswerable","publish_time":"2020","cluster_id":"354"},{"main_cord_uid":"jwb9n00x","cord_uid":"jwb9n00x","abstract":"Humoral responses in COVID-19 disease are often of limited durability, as seen with other human coronavirus epidemics.

Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in Bcl-6+TFH cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet+TH1 cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-a accumulation.

For estimation of the serial interval, we used data of the 51 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their 318 close contacts in Qom, Iran. The number of confirmed cases daily in the early phase of the outbreak and estimated serial interval were used for R0 estimation. We used the time-varying method as a method with the least bias to estimate R0 in Qom, Iran, and in China, Italy and South Korea. The serial interval was estimated with a gamma distribution, a mean of 4.55 days and a standard deviation of 3.30 days for the COVID-19 epidemic based on Qom data. The R0 in this study was estimated to be between 2 and 3 in Qom. Of the four countries studied, the lowest R0 was estimated in South Korea (1.5-2) and the highest in Iran (4-5). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that R0 is sensitive to the applied mean generation time. To the best of the authors\' knowledge, this study is the first to estimate R0 in Qom. To control the epidemic, the reproduction number should be reduced by decreasing the contact rate, decreasing the transmission probability and decreasing the duration of the infectious period.","title":"Estimation of the serial interval and basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Qom, Iran, and three other countries: A data-driven analysis in the early phase of the outbreak","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Qom, Iran\\r\\ndate: early phase of the outbreak\\r\\nR0 value: 2 and 3\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: time-varying method\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: South Korea\\r\\ndate: early phase of the outbreak\\r\\nR0 value: 1.5-2\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: time-varying method\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Iran\\r\\ndate: early phase of the outbreak\\r\\nR0 value: 4-5\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: time-varying method\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: China\\r\\ndate: early phase of the outbreak\\r\\nR0 value: -\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: time-varying method\\r\\n|\\r\\ndisease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Italy\\r\\ndate: early phase of the outbreak\\r\\nR0 value: -\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: time-varying method","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Qom, Iran\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"early phase of the outbreak\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"2 and 3\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"time-varying method\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"South Korea\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"early phase of the outbreak\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"1.5-2\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"time-varying method\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Iran\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"early phase of the outbreak\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"4-5\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"time-varying method\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"China\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"early phase of the outbreak\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"time-varying method\\"}},{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Italy\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"early phase of the outbreak\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"time-varying method\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"Qom, Iran\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"between 2 and 3\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"time-varying method\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"China, Italy and South Korea\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"time-varying method\\" } }, { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"China, Italy and South Korea\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"-\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"time-varying method\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020","cluster_id":"7"},{"main_cord_uid":"ktjbgcnw","cord_uid":"ktjbgcnw","abstract":"Since COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019, various public health interventions have been implemented across the world.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: To assess the rate at which an infectious disease can spread in a population, the 2 measures, R0 and Re or Rt, are widely used. One of the parameters which influence the calculations is the SI, the period between symptom onset in an infector and an infectee. METHODS: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Science Direct searching up to May 10, 2020, was performed. A continuous random-effect model was applied using the DerSimonian-Laird (inverse variance) method. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 39 articles met the eligibility criteria. Our results demonstrated the mean SI was 5.45 days, with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of 4.23 to 6.66. Pooled estimates for reproduction rates was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.69-3.59) for R0 and 3.18 (95% CI: 2.89-3.47) for Rt. Subgroup analysis by geographical region and date of publication revealed variations over both time and geography in calculated R0 and Rt values. As time has progressed, predicted R0 and Rt values had decreased globally. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings indicate that one SARS-CoV-2-infected person is likely to infect 3 persons, supporting that COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease. As an essential objective metrics implied in risk assessment for this emerging pandemic, monitoring R0 and Re is necessary to indicate the effectiveness or failures of mitigation efforts.","title":"Meta-Analysis on Serial Intervals and Reproductive Rates for SARS-CoV-2","annotator_investigating_R0":"-1","text_response":"unanswerable","json_response":"unanswerable","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"-\\", \\"date\\": \\"up to May 10, 2020\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"3.14\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"(95% CI: 2.69-3.59)\\", \\"method\\": \\"DerSimonian-Laird (inverse variance) method\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020"},{"main_cord_uid":"ozsm5r0m","cord_uid":"ozsm5r0m","abstract":"This study aimed to estimate the basic reproduction number and the time-varying estimate of effective reproductive number of COVID-19 in American countries as they implemented non-pharmacological strategies for the containment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Researchers and medical experts have made remarkable efforts to reduce the number of cases and prevent future outbreaks through vaccines and other measures. However, there is little evidence on how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection entropy can be applied in predicting the possible number of infections and deaths. In addition, more studies on how the COVID-19 infection density contributes to the rise in infections are needed. This study demonstrates how the SARS-COV-2 daily infection entropy can be applied in predicting the number of infections within a given period. In addition, the infection density within a given population attributes to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and, consequently, the new variants. RESULTS: Using the COVID-19 initial data reported by Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization (WHO) and Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), the result shows that the original SAR-COV-2 strain has R(0)<1 with an initial infection growth rate entropy of 9.11 bits for the United States (U.S.). At close proximity, the average infection time for an infected individual to infect others within a susceptible population is approximately 7 minutes. Assuming no vaccines were available, in the U.S., the number of infections could range between 41,220,199 and 82,440,398 in late March 2022 with approximately, 1,211,036 deaths. However, with the available vaccines, nearly 48 Million COVID-19 cases and 706, 437 deaths have been prevented. CONCLUSION: The proposed technique will contribute to the ongoing investigation of the COVID-19 pandemic and a blueprint to address the uncertainties surrounding the pandemic.","title":"Predicting the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in USA","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: USA\\r\\ndate: -\\r\\nR0 value: <1\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: -","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"USA\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"<1\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"-\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\", \\"location\\": \\"United States (U.S.)\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"R(0)1\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"-\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2022-03-28 10:00:00"},{"main_cord_uid":"v2loylpa","cord_uid":"v2loylpa","abstract":"Background: Amid a critical and emergent situation like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic related to extreme health and economic repercussions, we used and presented the mathematical modeling like susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) to have a numerical demonstration that can shed light to decide the fate of the scourge in Bangladesh. To describe the idea about the factors influencing the outbreak data, we presented the current situation of the COVID-19 outbreak with graphical trends. Methods: Primary data were collected and analyzed by using a pre-created Google Survey form having a pre-set questionnaire on the social distancing status of different districts. Secondary data on the total and the daily number of laboratory tests, confirmed positive cases, and death cases were extracted from the publicly available sources to make predictions. We estimated the basic reproduction number (R \xc3\u0192\xc2\xa2\xc3\u201a\xe2\u20ac\u201d\xc3\u201a\xc2\xa6) based on the SIR mathematical model and predicted the probable fate of this pandemic in Bangladesh. Results: Quarantine situations in different regions of Bangladesh were evaluated and presented. We also provided tentative forecasts until 31 May 2020 and found that the predicted curve followed the actual curve approximately. Estimated R \xc3\u0192\xc2\xa2\xc3\u201a\xe2\u20ac\u201d\xc3\u201a\xc2\xa6-values (6.924) indicated that infection rate would be greater than the recovery rate. Furthermore, by calibrating the parameters of the SIR model to fit the reported data, we assume the ultimate ending of the pandemic in Bangladesh by December 2022. Conclusion: We hope that the results of our analysis could contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak and help the concerned authority toward decision making.","title":"Prediction of Epidemics Trend of COVID-19 in Bangladesh","annotator_investigating_R0":"1","text_response":"disease name: COVID-19\\r\\nlocation: Bangladesh\\r\\ndate: until 31 May 2020\\r\\nR0 value: 6.924\\r\\n%CI values: -\\r\\nmethod: SIR mathematical model","json_response":"[{\\"contribution\\":{\\"disease name\\": \\"COVID-19\\",\\r\\n\\"location\\": \\"Bangladesh\\",\\r\\n\\"date\\": \\"until 31 May 2020\\",\\r\\n\\"R0 value\\": \\"6.924\\",\\r\\n\\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\",\\r\\n\\"method\\": \\"SIR mathematical model\\"}}]","json_model_response":"[ { \\"contribution\\": { \\"disease name\\": \\"coronavirus disease (COVID-19)\\", \\"location\\": \\"Bangladesh\\", \\"date\\": \\"-\\", \\"R0 value\\": \\"6.924\\", \\"%CI values\\": \\"-\\", \\"method\\": \\"SIR mathematical model\\" } } ]","publish_time":"2020"}]}'),De=["className","cssModule","fluid","tag"];function Oe(){return Oe=Object.assign?Object.assign.bind():function(e){for(var t=1;t<arguments.length;t++){var n=arguments[t];for(var a in n)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(n,a)&&(e[a]=n[a])}return e},Oe.apply(this,arguments)}function xe(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,a,i=function(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var n,a,i={},o=Object.keys(e);for(a=0;a<o.length;a++)n=o[a],t.indexOf(n)>=0||(i[n]=e[n]);return i}(e,t);if(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols){var o=Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(e);for(a=0;a<o.length;a++)n=o[a],t.indexOf(n)>=0||Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable.call(e,n)&&(i[n]=e[n])}return i}var Ve={tag:_,fluid:g().oneOfType([g().bool,g().string]),className:g().string,cssModule:g().object};function Te(e){var t=e.className,n=e.cssModule,a=e.fluid,i=e.tag,o=void 0===i?"div":i,s=xe(e,De),r="container";!0===a?r="container-fluid":a&&(r="container-".concat(a));var d=w(b()(t,r),n);return p.createElement(o,Oe({},s,{className:d}))}Te.propTypes=Ve;var Ae=Te,Ee=function(e){l(n,e);var t=h(n);function n(e){var i;a(this,n),(i=t.call(this,e)).onRefresh=function(){var e=ke.h[Math.floor(300*Math.random())+1];i.setState({title:e.title,abstract:e.abstract,label:e.json_response,prediction:e.json_model_response})};var o=ke.h[Math.floor(300*Math.random())+1];return i.state={title:o.title,abstract:o.abstract,label:o.json_response,prediction:o.json_model_response},i}return r(n,[{key:"render",value:function(){return(0,oe.jsx)("div",{children:(0,oe.jsxs)(Ae,{children:[(0,oe.jsx)(re,{}),(0,oe.jsx)(Se,{}),(0,oe.jsx)(ye,{title:this.state.title,abstract:this.state.abstract,onClick:this.onRefresh}),(0,oe.jsx)(_e,{label:this.state.label,prediction:this.state.prediction}),(0,oe.jsx)(le,{})]})})}}]),n}(e.Component),je=Ee,Me=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&n.e(787).then(n.bind(n,787)).then((function(t){var n=t.getCLS,a=t.getFID,i=t.getFCP,o=t.getLCP,s=t.getTTFB;n(e),a(e),i(e),o(e),s(e)}))};t.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render((0,oe.jsx)(e.StrictMode,{children:(0,oe.jsx)(je,{})})),Me()}()}();
